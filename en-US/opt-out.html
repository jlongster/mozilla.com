<h3>Omniture</h3>

<p>This section describes the procedure for opting out of Omniture-based web site analytics
tracking as used on Mozilla web sites. There are two basic methods that can be used
independently or in combination.</p>

<div class="corner-box">
<h4>Using cookies</h4>
<p>In order to opt out of Mozilla's Omniture-based analytics programs, you must install an "opt-out
cookie". Mozilla's web sites detect the presence of this "opt-out cookie" and disable tracking.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please visit <a href="http://ostats.mozilla.com/optout.html">this page</a> to enable or disable
the Mozilla "opt-out cookie"</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if you clear your cookies, delete the opt-out cookie, or if you change computers or Web browsers,
you will need to perform the opt-out procedure again. Otherwise, the cookie is good for a 2-year period
from the moment you "install" it.</p>
</div>

<div class="corner-box">
<h4>Using Hosts files </h4>

Another method to disable web site analytics is to block communications with the analytics servers. This
can be achieved by adding some lines to your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">hosts
file</a>. This will disable communications to the Omniture servers.

<p>
In order to use this method, your local machine's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">hosts file</a> must be modified.
To find the location of your hosts file on a particular platform,
see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">this article</a>. Open the file in a text
editor.</p>

<p>Add the following lines to disable Omniture analytics for Mozilla properties:</p>
<p><code>
127.0.0.1 ostats.mozilla.com<br />
127.0.0.1 sostats.mozilla.com<br />
127.0.0.1 mozilla.com.112.2o7.net
</code></p>

<p>Note that this only disables Omniture on Mozilla properties and not on every web site where Omniture
may be used.</p>
</div>

<h3>Webtrends</h3>

<p>This section describes the procedure for opting out of Webtrends-based web site analytics tracking as used on Mozilla web sites. There are two basic methods that can be used independently or in combination.</p>

<h4>Using cookies</h4>

<p>In order to opt out of Mozilla's Webtrends-based analytics programs, you must install an "opt-out cookie". Mozilla's web sites detect the presence of this "opt-out cookie" and disable tracking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please visit <a href='http://ondemand.webtrends.com/support/optout.asp?action=out&amp;status=completed'>this page</a> to enable or disable the Mozilla "opt-out cookie"</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if you clear your cookies, delete the opt-out cookie, or if you change computers or Web browsers, you will need to perform the opt-out procedure again. Otherwise, the cookie is good for a 10-year period from the moment you "install" it.</p>
