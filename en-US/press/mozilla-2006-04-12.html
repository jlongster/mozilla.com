<h2>Mozilla Showcases First Round of Community Produced "Firefox Flicks" Videos</h2>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - April 12, 2006 - Mozilla today began showcasing the first round of community-created videos promoting Firefox as part of the <a href="http://www.firefoxflicks.com">Firefox Flicks</a> marketing campaign. Firefox is the award-winning, free Web browser from Mozilla that has been downloaded over 160 million times.</p>

<p>In Nov. 2004, Spread Firefox volunteers designed and underwrote a two-page ad in the <em>New York Times</em> to announce the release of Firefox 1.0. The <em>New York Times</em> campaign kicked off Mozilla's unique approach to grassroots marketing. Today, tens of millions of people worldwide are enjoying the better Web experience offered by Firefox. This year, the community is raising the bar with Firefox Flicks, the first large-scale community-produced video campaign for a software product.</p>

<p>"We're very impressed with the videos that have been contributed so far. Our community is not only producing some great ads, they are also having a lot of fun," said Asa Dotzler, Mozilla community coordinator. "The authenticity and fresh perspective of the videos we've seen is inspiring. We invite everyone to check out the videos at FirefoxFlicks.com."</p>

<p>Hosting of the Firefox Flicks videos is powered by Revver (<a href="http://www.revver.com">www.revver.com</a>), a service that allows video creators to freely distribute, track and receive compensation for their original videos anywhere online. Videos will be released under a Creative Commons license to encourage widespread sharing, with new videos released daily.</p>
