    <h2>NEW ROUND OF RELEASES EXTENDS MOZILLA PROJECTS STANDARDS BASED OPEN SOURCE OFFERINGS</h2>
    <p class="sub-title">Mozilla Firebird evolves into the new Firefox 0.8 release. Thunderbird 0.5 released.</p>
    <p>February 9, 2004 (the Internet) - The Mozilla Foundation today announced the immediate 
       availability of a new preview release of its next generation web browser, Mozilla Firefox.  
       Mozilla Firefox 0.8 represents the bleeding edge of Internet technology and raises the bar 
       for ease of use, performance, robustness and standards compliance.</p>
    <p>The new release marks a significant milestone on the development roadmap towards the highly 
       anticipated 1.0 release of the Mozilla projects next generation web browser. New features 
       in this release include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A powerful new download manager that makes tracking multiple downloads easier;</li>
      <li>Numerous improvements to bookmarks handling, making it easier than ever to keep track 
          of your favorite sites;</li>
      <li>Improved handling of extensions - small, easy to download applications that can be 
          installed with a few simple mouse clicks and extend the browsers functionality.  
          Community members have created more than 200 such extensions, including add-ons that 
          remove ad banners, add spell-checker functionality, and add the ability to search 
          Amazon.com, eBay or other popular sites from the Firefox toolbar;</li>
      <li>An easy to use installer for Microsoft Windows users;</li>
      <li>A new default theme for Mac OS X users that integrates seamlessly with the OS X desktop 
          environment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Firefox 0.8 continues to build increasing levels of performance and stability into the 
       browser. Hundreds of volunteer developers and testers contributed numerous bug fixes, 
       new features and security improvements during this development cycle, again demonstrating 
       the strength of the open source communitys commitment to powerful, stable and secure 
       applications.</p>
    <p>The new release also marks a name change for the new browser, which was previously known 
       as Mozilla Firebird.  We are pleased to release a new preview version of Mozilla 
       Firefox, commented Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla Foundation. To avoid 
       overlap with another open source project, we have decided to change the name of 
       this product from Mozilla Firebird to Mozilla Firefox.</p>
    <p>Along with the new name, Firefox sports a new logo and the Mozilla Foundation is kicking 
       off a grass-roots Get Firefox campaign to spread word about the new browser.</p>

    <h4>Mozilla Thunderbird 0.5: Enterprise-grade email</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Foundation also announced the latest preview release of its new email 
       application, Mozilla Thunderbird. </p>
    <p>Responding to strong interest in Thunderbird among enterprises and educational 
       institutions, Thunderbird 0.5 includes numerous improvements aimed at enterprise users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to synchronize address books with Palm devices;</li>
      <li>IMAP performance and interoperability improvements;</li>
      <li>Secure password authentication using SSPI NTLM for SMTP and POP3;</li>
      <li>Improved LDAP support;</li>
      <li>Improved migration from Netscape 4.x;</li>

    <h4>Mozilla 1.6: 1,000 reasons to get it; closing in on 1,000,000 downloads in 20 days</h4>
    <p>While Mozilla Firefox 0.8 and Mozilla Thunderbird 0.5 are preview releases of the 
       Mozilla projects next generation standalone web browser and email application, Mozilla 
       1.6 is a mature Internet suite that combines a web browser, email client, easy to use 
       web page editor and Internet Chat software.  In the twenty days since its release, 
       Mozilla 1.6 has been downloaded close to a million times, setting a new record for 
       the Mozilla project  a powerful testament to the pent-up user demand for an 
       evolutionary, feature-rich, stable and secure web browser suite.  Mozilla 1.6 has 
       received rave reviews from users and media alike and includes close to 1000 bug fixes,
