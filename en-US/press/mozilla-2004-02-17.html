stronghold in Europe</span><br />
Mozilla Europe founded to advance Mozilla products in Europe.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>February 17, 2004 (the Internet) - The Mozilla Foundation and
European Mozilla contributors today announced the launch of the
www.mozilla-europe.org web site and the Mozilla Europe non-profit
organization to promote, develop and help deploy Mozilla products in
Europe. These products include the award-winning Mozilla 1.6 web
browser.</p>
<p>The Mozilla Europe initiative was founded by Peter Van der Beken and
Tristan Nitot, both Mozilla contributors located in Europe, in order to
leverage Europe as a source of contributors and users of the products.</p>
<p>The www.mozilla-europe.org web site is launched simultaneously in
four languages (English, French, German and Spanish), underlining the
added value that Mozilla Europe brings to the Mozilla project by
leveraging Europe's Mozilla volunteers and their expertise in
localization. Other translations will follow soon, starting with Dutch,
Italian and Slovak.</p>
<p>"We see a tremendous potential for the Mozilla products in Europe.
The European market is looking for reliable, secure and cross-platform
web browsers and e-mail clients, and Mozilla is extremely well
positioned to deliver on these needs", says Tristan Nitot, President of
Mozilla Europe. "The products are great, users love them. But we know
that giving away the best products is not enough, and we feel that
companies and public services alike need local representation to
discuss product evolution and ask for services before deploying Mozilla
products on a large scale. We are here to help them".</p>
<p>Mitchell Baker, for the Mozilla Foundation, added: "We are delighted
to see local, trusted, long-time Mozilla contributors create the first
international Mozilla affiliate organization to help foster Mozilla
development and deployment in Europe. There's tremendous untapped
interest in Mozilla products in Europe from end users, public
institutions and the private sector as well as a community of volunteer
contributors that's eager to move the project to the next level. The
Mozilla Europe team brings an impressive set of skills to achieve these
dual goals of fostering Mozilla adoption and building an even more
active community of Mozilla developers in Europe".</p>
<p>Tristan Nitot brings to Mozilla Europe his experience of Marketing,
Technical Training, Technology Evangelism and Business Development in
the IT industry, including 7 years at Netscape-AOL.</p>
<p>Peter Van der Beken, co-founder and Technical Director, brings to
Mozilla Europe his 5 years' experience of working on the Mozilla
project, recently as the XLST module owner, DOM module co-owner and
super-reviewer. In the past, Mr. Van der Beken used to represent
AOL/Netscape at the W3C XSLT Working Group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pascal Chevrel, French citizen, renowned for helping French and
Spanish Mozilla users with technical support issues;</li>
  <li>Axel Hecht, German citizen and Mozilla contributor;</li>
  <li>Olivier Meunier, French citizen and open source software DotClear
