<h2>Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird to Support New Open Standard Platform for USB Drives</h2>

<p class="sub-title">Award-winning Open Source Software to Extend Reach with U3 Platform</p>


<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - January 7th, 2005 - The Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving choice and promoting innovation on the Internet, today announced that its Mozilla Firefox web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird e-mail client will support the new U3 standard for managing applications and data on USB flash drives, allowing people to easily carry, store and launch Mozilla software from any PC.


As
an industry consortium founded by SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and M-Systems  (NASDAQ: FLSH) along with other industry leading software vendors and content providers,  U3 looks to expand the USB Flash Drive technology market beyond storage by creating an open standard platform to attract a community of independent developers to build applications for U3 devices.    Through Mozilla's vibrant open source development community, an existing project to provide portable versions of Firefox and Thunderbird for USB flash drives, led by volunteer developers, will be extended to embrace this new standard.</p>

<p>"We are pleased to have the opportunity to include support for an open standard USB development platform</span>," commented Chris Hofmann, Director of Engineering of the Mozilla Foundation. <span>"We believe our users will value the portability and flexibility this will provide them in being able to use Firefox and Thunderbird on any PC wherever they are."</p>


<p>"We at U3 are very proud to have the Mozilla Foundation as a supporter of our program," said Kate Purmal, interim executive director of U3. U3 is committed to increasing the value and expanding the market for USB flash by attracting a community of independent software vendors to create novel and useful applications for a new USB flash drive platform."</p>
