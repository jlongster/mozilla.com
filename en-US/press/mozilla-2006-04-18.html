<h2>Mozilla Receives Over 280 Community Produced Videos for "Firefox Flicks"</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Winners to be announced at San Francisco International Film Festival</p>


<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - April 18, 2006 -  Mozilla today announced that it has received over 280 community-created videos promoting Firefox as entries to the Firefox Flicks marketing campaign. Firefox is the award-winning, free Web browser from Mozilla that has been downloaded over 160 million times.</p>

<p>Accomplished Hollywood and Madison Avenue judges - including the talents behind <em>Charlie's Angels</em>, <em>American Pie</em>, and <em>Six Feet Under</em> - will select three winners, who will be announced next week at the <a href="http://fest06.sffs.org/">2006 San Francisco International Film Festival</a> (SFIFF). Mozilla is a sponsor of the SFIFF and will host an awards reception and screening of the finalists on April 27, 2006, at the Kabuki Theater in San Francisco, California. The awards reception will also feature a panel discussion on the emergence of community-powered video on the Web, including speakers from Butler, Shine & Stern, Current TV, and Revver.</p>

<p>In Nov. 2004, Spread Firefox volunteers designed and underwrote a two-page ad in the <em>New York Times</em> to announce the release of Firefox 1.0. The <em>New York Times</em> campaign kicked off Mozilla's unique approach to grassroots marketing. Today, tens of millions of people worldwide are enjoying the better Web experience offered by Firefox. This year, the community is raising the bar with Firefox Flicks, the first large-scale community-produced video campaign for a software product. Winning Flicks entries will be featured in upcoming marketing campaigns for Firefox. </p>

"The reaction to the first wave of Firefox Flicks videos has been awesome. In the first week, these community produced videos have been viewed over one million times," said Asa Dotzler, Mozilla community coordinator. "We'll be posting new entries every day at FirefoxFlicks.com and invite everyone to come check them out."
</p>

<p>Hosting of the Firefox Flicks videos is powered by Revver (<a href="http://www.revver.com">www.revver.com</a>), a service that allows video creators to freely distribute, track and receive compensation for their original videos anywhere online. Videos will be released under a Creative Commons license to encourage widespread sharing, with new videos released daily.</p>
