<h2>Firefox 1.5 Adds Answers.com for Quick Reference</h2>

<p class="sub-title">Integrated Dictionaries and Encyclopedias Built into Search Toolbar</p>

<p><strong>New York, NY and Mountain View, CA &#8212; Nov. 30, 2005</strong> &#8212; Answers Corporation (NASD: ANSW), formerly GuruNet, creator of Answers.com, the answer-based search engine, and Mozilla Corp.,  creator of Firefox, announced today that the newest version 1.5 of the popular Mozilla Firefox Web browser provides Answers.com embedded in its search toolbar for reference and definition lookup.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are proud to be included as the dictionary and reference solution in Firefox, which claims over 100 million downloads to date,&#8221; said Bob Rosenschein, Answers&#8217; CEO. &#8220;This serves as further validation of our &#8216;one-stop answers&#8217; approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Firefox 1.5 will deliver a better Web experience for our tens of millions of users,&#8221; said Christopher Beard, vice president of products for Mozilla Corp. &#8220;We believe that including Answers.com in the Firefox search toolbar supports our goal of providing a Web browser that empowers people to look up facts more effectively on the Web.&#8221; </p>

<p>Answers.com also offers extra functionality for Firefox users, including &#8220;right-click menu&#8221; lookup and a search sidebar, at <a href="http://www.answers.com/main/firefox_plugins.jsp">http://www.answers.com/main/firefox_plugins.jsp</a>. The extension improves ease-of-use by allowing users to look up any word by simply pressing &#8220;Alt&#8221; while clicking on the word.</p>

<p>The agreement calls for an ad-revenue split between Answers and Mozilla on Answers traffic originating from the Firefox search toolbar.</p>
