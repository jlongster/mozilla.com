<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES SECURITY BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM</h2>
<p class="sub-title">
Program harnesses power of the open source community to identify
security vulnerabilities before they are exploited</p>
<p>
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - August 2, 2004 - The Mozilla Foundation today
announced the Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program, an initiative that
rewards users who identify and report security vulnerabilities in the
open source project's software. Under the new program, users reporting
critical security bugs - as judged by the Mozilla Foundation staff -
will collect a $500 cash prize. The new initiative was launched with
funding from leading Linux software developer Linspire, Inc., and
renowned Internet entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth.</p>
<p>
"As Mozilla software builds momentum in the marketplace, I'm inspired
by the Mozilla Foundation's enduring commitment to transparency and
responsiveness on security issues, and I am happy to support this
program," commented Mark Shuttleworth.</p>
<p>
Identifying software security vulnerabilities requires constant
vigilance, and preventing those issues from becoming problems
necessitates a dedicated effort to provide quick and effective
responses. The Mozilla project has developed a community of users
and developers who are passionate about computer security and who
continuously provide feedback on Mozilla software. The Mozilla
Security Bug Bounty Program seeks to further encourage the community's
focus on security consciousness and responsiveness.</p>
<p>
"This program reflects our commitment to protecting consumers from
malicious actors," commented Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla
Foundation. "Recent events illustrate the need for this type of
commitment. While no software is immune from security vulnerabilities,
bugs in open source projects are often identified and fixed more
quickly. The Security Bug Bounty Program will help us unearth security
issues earlier, allowing our supporters to provide us with a head start
on correcting vulnerabilities before they are exploited by malicious
hackers." </p>
<p>
Security experts agree that it is virtually impossible to produce
software that is absolutely secure against all possible attacks.
As a result, experts recommend that software combine a strong security
design and good security practices to maximize the amount of protection
available. The Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program provides an
additional mechanism for identifying potential vulnerabilities.<br />
</p>
<p>"Worry-free security on the Internet is long overdue and we're
committed to supporting the Mozilla Foundation's efforts to give users
peace of mind," said Michael Robertson, Chief Executive Officer of
Linspire, Inc. "We strongly urge the open source community to take
advantage of this initiative to help identify and report any security
problems for correction." </p>
<p>
Linspire, Inc., and Mark Shuttleworth have issued seed funding to
support this initiative, to be supplemented by donations from Mozilla
supporters. The Mozilla Foundation is inviting its users and
supporters to contribute to this initiative by making donations to the
bounty's fund. Tax-deductible contributions can be made through
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate.html">http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate.html</a>.
The first $5,000
in community contributions will be matched dollar for dollar by Mark
Shuttleworth.</p>

Users who identify security bugs in Mozilla software are encouraged to

which bugs are eligible and how to claim the bounty. </p>
