<h2>The World Economic Forum Announces Technology Pioneers 2007: Mozilla Selected</h2>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. -- Dec. 4 2006 – The World Economic Forum today announced 47 Technology Pioneers for 2007. Mozilla has been selected as one of these Technology Pioneers. The Technology Pioneers were nominated by the world’s leading venture capital and technology companies. The final selection from 225 nominees was made by a panel of leading technology experts appointed by the World Economic Forum. Technology Pioneers 2007 are invited to attend the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum to be held in Davos, Switzerland from 24-28 January 2007.</p>

<p>Mozilla is a global community dedicated to building free, open source products and technologies that improve the Internet experience for people everywhere. The award-winning Mozilla Firefox browser is the result of Mozilla’s highly-disciplined, transparent and cooperative development process that cultivates community-based innovation. Mitchell Baker, CEO and president of Mozilla Corp., will represent the Mozilla organization at this year’s conference. Baker is responsible for organizing and motivating the massive, worldwide collective of volunteers and employees who are breathing new life into the Internet.</p>

<p>“Our ongoing, singular focus at Mozilla is meeting the needs of Web users worldwide. By creating a choice in how people access and experience the Web, we have spurred a revival in the browser market and changed the way people interact with the Web for the better,” said Baker. “Being awarded the opportunity to participate in the World Economic Forum is an honor and a testament to the strength of our community.”</p>

<p>Technology Pioneers are companies that have been identified as developing and applying highly transformational and innovative technologies in the areas of energy, biotechnology and health, and information technology. This year’s class of companies has been selected not only because of the cutting-edge work undertaken by these organizations, but also because their work has potential long-term impact on business and society.</p>

<p>The companies’ products include microscopic pill cameras, bio sensors that localize landmines, implantable medical devices for the treatment of brain tumours, mobile television service, blog search engines, open source web browsers, video headsets, thin-film diamond coatings, solar air-conditioner equipment, paper batteries for music-playing greeting cards, and even an automatic and compacting trash bin powered by solar energy.</p>

<p>Over half (27) of the Technology Pioneers 2007 are US-based companies, with 13 located in California. The United Kingdom boasts six Technology Pioneers 2007; the Netherlands, India, Israel and Singapore boast two each; Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland have one each.</p>

<p>“The competition to become a Technology Pioneer has been more intense than ever. It is evident that technology and innovation is playing a key role in the shifting power equation at a global level. Driving this shift is the tremendous amount of innovation taking place outside of traditionally hubs. The wide geographic spread of this year’s Technology Pioneers is a testament to this trend. We are pleased to welcome these exciting companies to our Community of Technology Pioneers, and look forward to engaging these industry leaders of the future into the community of the World Economic Forum”, said Peter Torreele, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum.</p>

<p>To be selected as a Technology Pioneer, a company must be involved in the development of life-changing technology innovation and have the potential for long-term impact on business and society. In addition, it must demonstrate visionary leadership, show all the signs of being a long-standing market leader – and its technology must be proven. Previous Technology Pioneers have included Autonomy, Cambridge Silicon Radio, Encore Software, Google, Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Napster.</p>

<p>The selection criteria include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Innovation. The company’s technology must be truly innovative. A new version or repackaging of an already well-accepted technological solution does not qualify as an innovation. The innovation should be recent – not more than two years old. The company should invest significantly in R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Potential Impact. This company’s technology must have the potential to have a substantial long-term impact on business and society in the future.</li>
<li>Growth and Sustainability. The company should have all the signs of being a long-term market leader and should have well-formulated plans for future development and growth.</li>
<li>Proof of Concept. The company must have a product on the market or have proven practical applications of the technology. Companies in “stealth” mode and companies with untested ideas or models will not qualify.</li>
<li>Leadership. The company must have visionary leadership that plays a critical role in driving the company towards reaching its goals.</li>
<li>Status. The company must not currently be a Member of the World Economic Forum. This criterion applies to the parent company – thus wholly-owned subsidiaries of large firms are not eligible.</li>
<li>In October 2006, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 2, a major update to its popular and acclaimed Web browser.  Improvements to the user interface, security tools and customization options combine to deliver a rich, engaging, safer and more productive Web browsing experience for all.</li>
