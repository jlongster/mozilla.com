  rallies supporters to Take Back The Web</h2>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mozilla Developer Day 2004 set to be a
  stunning success</h2>

  <p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><i>Open source developers
  gather to set the course for Mozilla&rsquo;s future.</i></p>

  <p>February 27, 2004 (Mountain View, CA) &ndash; In its first on-site live
  gathering of open source Mozilla developers since the organization was
  established last July, the Mozilla Foundation is hosting Developer Day on
  Friday February 27, 2004 at its Mountain View, CA, headquarters.</p>

  <p>As an open source project, the Mozilla Foundation relies on a vibrant
  community of volunteer developers for its continued success. Foundation
  staffers and contributors from around the globe will gather to learn,
  collaborate, exchange ideas and discuss the future direction of the Mozilla
  project and its initiatives.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gathering our community to celebrate our progress and
  collaborate on development initiatives,&rdquo; said Chris Hofmann, the
  Mozilla Foundation&rsquo;s Director of Engineering. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
  to set a course for what we think are the most important things to be doing
  over the next few quarters to take our development to the next
  level.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A number of critical topics will be addressed on Developer Day:</p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>
      <p>An update on the activities of the Mozilla Foundation itself will be
      delivered by Mitchell Baker, the Foundation&rsquo;s president, and Chris
      Hofmann.</p>
    </li>

    <li>

      <p>Brendan Eich, the Mozilla project&rsquo;s Chief Architect, will lead
      an overview and roundtable discussion of the Mozilla Roadmap.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Mozilla QA lead Asa Dotzler will be leading a discussion about QA and
      testing.</p>
    </li>

    <li>

      <p>A discussion on new Mozilla applications, status and direction will be
      led by Ben Goodger and Scott MacGregor, the project leaders for the new
      Mozilla Firefox web browser and Thunderbird mail client,
      respectively.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>A variety of other presentations will be provided by members of the
      Mozilla development community on topics such as building rich web
      services applications using the Mozilla platform.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>&ldquo;We want to provide clear direction about where the project is
  heading and get everybody lined up to do the work that needs to be
  done,&rdquo; stated Chris Hofmann.</p>The difference between a closed
  proprietary development process and the freedom and innovation of the open
  source model is one of the underpinnings of Mozilla&rsquo;s Developer Day.
  Open source means open collaboration and a free exchange of ideas, which is
  what this event is all about.

  <p>The Mozilla project is riding a torrent of industry, media and end user
  praise for the Mozilla 1.6 Internet suite and recently released technology
  previews of the organization&rsquo;s next generation Mozilla Firefox browser
  and Thunderbird email application. For example, close to one million people
  downloaded Mozilla 1.6 in the first 20 days after it was released and an even
  greater number have downloaded Mozilla Firefox 0.8 since it was released on
  February 9. The rapidly growing demand for Mozilla applications continues to
  showcase the innovative capacity and excellence of its open source
  development model.</p>

  <p>A webcast of the event will be made available after its completion,
  further enabling open access to the wider Mozilla community of developers and
  contributors.</p>
