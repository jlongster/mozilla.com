<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION RELEASES SECURITY UPDATE TO FIREFOX</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Proactive security update fixes bug prior to any known exploits</p>
<p>
March 23, 2005, (Mountain View, CA). The Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving choice and promoting innovation on the Internet, today announced a security update for its <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox Web browser</a>.  The update is a proactive security release to patch a bug identified by Internet Security Systems, a premier security research, products, and services company.  No known exploits of the bug have been reported prior to the update's release.
</p>
<p>
"The Mozilla Foundation is deeply committed to providing its users with the safest Internet experience possible," said Chris Hofmann, director of engineering for the Mozilla Foundation. "To deliver our users the experience they deserve, we must stay ahead of the curve in patching potential vulnerabilities.  For example, the bug patched in this update has no known real world exploits, and we were able to provide a quick response."
</p>
<p>The Mozilla Foundation evaluates security issues on an ongoing basis and will issue security updates as warranted.  Users are encouraged to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">download</a> the software updates at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">www.mozilla.org</a>.</p>
<p>
Firefox has been widely praised for its stability, trustworthiness and innovative features including tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, built-in pop-up blocking, and hundreds of available extensions. SC Magazine, a leading security magazine, recently awarded the Mozilla Foundation with its Editor in Chief award. The browser has been downloaded more that 30 million times and is available in 28 languages.</p>
