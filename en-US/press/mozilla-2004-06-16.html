<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION RELEASES THUNDERBIRD 0.7</h2> 
<p class="sub-title">Latest release of open source email app helps users reclaim their Inbox. </p>

<p>
June 16, 2004 (Mountain View, CA) Â– The Mozilla Foundation today announced the release 
of its next generation e-mail client, Mozilla Thunderbird version 0.7. 
Thunderbird makes e-mailing safer, faster and easier than ever before with the industry's best 
implementations of features such as intelligent spam filters, a built-in spell checker, 
extension support, and much more. 
</p>

<p>
&quot;This release, with our smaller download size and performance improvements, marks a big step 
forward in our efforts to make Thunderbird easy to get and even easier to use,&quot; commented Scott MacGregor, 
Lead Engineer for Mozilla Thunderbird, &quot;Combined with our adaptive junk mail controls and powerful tools like 
quick search, Thunderbird allows users to reclaim their Inbox.&quot; 
</p>

<p>New features in Thunderbird 0.7 include: 
  <ul>
    <li> Smaller Download: The Windows version of Thunderbird is now only a 5.9 MB download, making downloading Thunderbird
         a breeze for dial-up and broadband users alike. 
    <li>Faster: Significant performance improvements on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
    <li>Extension/Theme Manager: New Extension and Theme Managers provide a convenient and secure way to manage and 
        update the many add-ons that set Thunderbird apart from other e-mail clients.
    <li>Improved support for IMAP protocol extensions makes Thunderbird the perfect 
        solution for enterprise users, who are already deploying Thunderbird to up to 
        50,000 users at a time.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Thunderbird also includes numerous bug fixes and incremental improvements that make 0.7
the most usable and stable version of Thunderbird to date.
</p>

<p>The release of Thunderbird 0.7 follows yesterday's release of Firefox 0.9, 
the Mozilla Foundation's next generation web browser. 
</p>
