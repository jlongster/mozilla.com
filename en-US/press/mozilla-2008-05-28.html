<h1>Mozilla Aims to Set Guinness World Record on Firefox 3 Download Day</h1>
<p><em>Global grassroots initiative seeks to establish new record for largest number of software downloads in 24 hours </em></p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – May 28, 2008 – Mozilla today announced its intent to set a brand new Guinness World Record for the largest number of software downloads in 24 hours. The record-setting attempt is planned for the launch day for Firefox 3, also known as Download Day. Mozilla is inviting its global community to spread the word and join the effort by pledging to download Firefox 3 and hosting regional download “fests.”</p>

<p>Since 2004, the Firefox community has grown to more than 175 million users. Firefox is available in more than 45 languages and used in more than 230 countries. Every day, the enthusiasm of the community is reflected in grassroots efforts happening all over the world as people share Firefox with their friends and families.  Download Day continues this tradition by harnessing the energy of the Firefox community to improve the online experience for people everywhere.</p>
