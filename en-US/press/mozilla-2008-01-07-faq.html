<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="mozilla-2008-01-07.html">View Press Release</a></p>

<dl>

<dt>Why is John taking over the role of CEO?</dt>
<dd>The Mozilla Corporation’s role and effect on the industry is increasing and requires different focus and execution and John’s the right person to provide this. Mitchell will be actively engaged and will focus on increasing Mozilla’s voice in several initiatives that impact the broader Internet. </dd>

<dt>Why now?</dt>
<dd>We now have the stability, with the success we’ve had with our products, to make this change. We also have the opportunity to launch new initiatives and broaden the scope of Mozilla.</dd>

<dt>Did you conduct a formal search for a new CEO?</dt>
<dd>No, it’s a highly specialized job that requires a set of skills and fundamental alignment with Mozilla’s values.  The CEO needs to balance economic growth and mission-driven goals for Mozilla.</dd>

<dt>Why John?</dt>
<dd>John’s been a CEO before and he has exactly the right set of skills and expertise for the job. John has increasingly been tackling more CEO-level responsibilities since he took on the COO role in August of 2006.</dd>

<dt>What is Mitchell’s new role in the company? Will she remain a full-time employee?</dt>
<dd>As Chairman of Mozilla Corporation, Mitchell will continue to use Mozilla’s impact in the market to make openness, collaboration and user control central in other products, services and aspects of online life.  She will remain a full-time employee.</dd>

<dt>How will day-to-day operations change?</dt>
<dd>Not much will change in day-to-day operations.  This is formalizing a relationship that exists already.   Virtually no reporting relationships will change.</dd>

<dt>When is John’s position as CEO effective?</dt>
<dd>This is effective immediately.</dd>

<dt>Is John becoming CEO of both the Mozilla Corp and the Mozilla Foundation?</dt>
<dd>John is CEO of the Mozilla Corporation.  The corporation is an important part of meeting the foundation’s mission.  He is not taking on a role with the Foundation. This won’t change relationships with other leaders in Mozilla.</dd>

<dt>What is John’s background?</dt>
<dd>John’s served on the boards of the Open Source Applications Foundation and Participatory Culture Foundation. Since 2005, he has served as Chief Operating Officer and been a member of the Board of Directors for Mozilla Corporation. Prior to this, he was the founder, CEO, CTO and VP of products for Reactivity, an XML Security Company that was ultimately acquired by Cisco.  He earned a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer science from Stanford University.</dd>

<dt>Will you be looking for a replacement for the COO position?</dt>
<dd>Not at this time. However, we’re always looking for people to build the Mozilla vision and we continue to hire at all levels. </dd>

<dt>How long was Mitchell CEO of Mozilla?</dt>
<dd>Mitchell has served as Mozilla’s Chief Lizard Wrangler since its founding in 1999.  She became Mozilla’s formal CEO in 2005.</dd>
