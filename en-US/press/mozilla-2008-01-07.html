<h1>Mozilla Appoints John Lilly as Chief Executive Officer</h1>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. - January 7, 2008 - Mozilla Corporation today announced the appointment of current chief operating officer John Lilly as its CEO, effective immediately. Concurrent with the appointment of Lilly, Mozilla also announced that Mitchell Baker, Mozilla’s current CEO, would continue as Chairman and a full-time executive of the corporation.</p>

<p>“John Lilly is the right person to guide the maturation of Mozilla,” said Mitchell Baker, Chairman of Mozilla Corporation. “John has been instrumental in developing an organization that is both embedded in Mozilla and open-source DNA and that can function at the extremely high degree of effectiveness that our setting requires.”</p>

The Web is the single most important innovation of our lifetimes – it affects everything,” said Lilly.  “With thousands of open source contributors, more than 125 million users, and countless organizations who rely on Mozilla’s community and technology, we're in rarefied territory.”</p>

<p>“I've worked with both Mitchell and John for a number of years now, and I strongly support these moves at Mozilla, which should allow the organization to do more things than ever before and to do them well,” said Mitch Kapor, board member and former chairman, Mozilla Foundation.</p>
