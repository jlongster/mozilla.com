<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES XFORMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Novell, IBM join in effort to implement W3C's XForms recommendation</p>
<p>
August 11, 2004, (Mountain View, CA). The Mozilla Foundation, in
collaboration with Novell and IBM, today announced the formation of a
project to implement the W3C's XForms 1.0 Recommendation. XForms is the
forms module in XHTML 2, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), which enables developers to deliver the type of next-generation,
rich, portable web-based applications desired by corporate IT. 
</p>
<p>
XForms 1.0 follows on the success of HTML forms and will provide
sophisticated forms technology for future XHTML-based applications.
XForms combines the ability to separate purpose, presentation, and
results with the Extensible Markup Language (XML). XForms is key to
realizing the vision of a future where people can access information
online on any device--and do everything from shopping and banking to
checking their e-mail or calendar. Using XForms, an enterprise can
ensure increased accessibility of electronic web transactions in order
to meet Federal Accessibility Guidelines as mandated by Section 508.
</p>
