<h2>Mozilla Releases Thunderbird 1.5 Email Client</h2>
<p class="sub-title">New Version of Acclaimed Email Client Delivers an Even Better and Safer Email Experience</p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Jan. 12, 2006 - Mozilla Corp. today announced the launch of Thunderbird 1.5, the latest version of its full-featured email client, available now as a free download at www.getthunderbird.com.  Renowned for its intelligent spam filters and customizable views, Thunderbird has attracted more than 18 million downloads since its launch in December 2004. Thunderbird 1.5 is the culmination of a year&#8217;s worth of feedback from its users and delivers a safe, fast and easy-to-use email solution.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a host of new and improved features, Thunderbird 1.5 provides users with a robust, free email alternative,&#8221; said Christopher Beard, vice president of products at Mozilla Corp.  &#8220;Thunderbird enhances the overall email experience, adding anti-phishing capabilities to help keep people safer, while also integrating and simplifying access to new technologies, such as RSS (Really Simple Syndication).&#8221;</p>

<h3>Better than Ever</h3>

<p>Thunderbird 1.5 features several enhancements, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Streamlined and Automated Updates: Thunderbird 1.5&#8217;s new software update mechanism streamlines product upgrades, making it easier for users to get the latest security and feature updates to Thunderbird.  Thunderbird automatically downloads these small updates in the background and prompts users when they are ready for installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Greater Spam Control and Security: Thunderbird 1.5&#8217;s refined spam filtering helps users block out unwanted junk email. Its new built-in &#8220;phishing&#8221; detector helps protect users against email scams by flagging suspicious email messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced Support for RSS and Podcasting: Thunderbird&#8217;s support for RSS allows users to receive feed updates as email messages, filtering and organizing these updates as they would ordinary email. Thunderbird 1.5 also allows users to access podcasts via a dialog box that provides access to a &#8220;helper&#8221; application such as a Web browser or audio player.   </p></li>
<li><p>Improved Productivity: Thunderbird 1.5 boasts several refinements that take the hassle out of email, including &#8220;spell check as you type&#8221;, &#8220;auto save as draft&#8221; mail composition, and the ability to delete attachments from email.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thunderbird 1.5 is available immediately as a free download from www.getthunderbird.com.</p>
