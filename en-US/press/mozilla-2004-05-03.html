<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION RELEASES THUNDERBIRD 0.6</h2> 


<p>
May 3, 2004 (Mountain View, CA)  The Mozilla Foundation today announced the release 
of its next generation email client, Mozilla Thunderbird version 0.6. 
Thunderbird makes emailing safer, faster and easier than ever before with the industry's best 
implementations of features such as intelligent spam filters, a built-in spell checker, 
extension support, and much more. 
</p>

<p>
&quot;This release, with our security and IMAP improvements, marks a big step forward 
in our efforts to produce a best of breed cross platform e-mail client 
ready for the enterprise,&quot; commented Scott MacGregor, Engineering Lead for Mozilla Thunderbird.
</p>

<p>Thunderbird 0.6 packs an array of powerful new features that make email easier to use:
  <ul>
    <li>A new installer for Windows makes it a breeze to start using Thunderbird.</li>
    <li>Improved Junk Mail Controls.  Thunderbirds spam filters, which get smarter 
        as you teach them what is spam and whats not, have been re-designed to learn 
        faster and catch more spam.</li>
    <li>The Mac OS X version of Thunderbird sports a beautiful new theme that matches 
        the OS X look and feel.  The theme, and a spiffy new Thunderbird logo, 
        were created by the Mozilla projects Visual Identify Team.</li>
    <li>Improved support for IMAP protocol extensions makes Thunderbird the perfect 
        solution for enterprise users, who are already deploying Thunderbird to up to 
        50,000 users at a time.</li>
    <li>Secure Password Authentication. Thunderbird includes Secure Password Authentication 
        using a new cross-platform NTLM authentication mechanism for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP. </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Thunderbird also includes numerous bug fixes and incremental improvements that make 0.6 
the most usable and stable version of Thunderbird to date.
</p>
