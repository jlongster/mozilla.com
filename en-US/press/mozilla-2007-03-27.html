<h2>Mozilla Launches New Firefox Add-ons Web Site</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Delivers thousands of free customization options for Firefox users and enhanced developer tools</p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – Mar. 27, 2007 – Mozilla today launched a new Firefox Add-ons Web site (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">https://addons.mozilla.org</a>) that makes it even easier for Firefox users to find and install thousands of free extensions and themes for a totally customized browsing experience. The new site also draws on the Mozilla community and a wide range of new tools, testing and support applications to help developers create and deliver high quality add-ons for Firefox users.</p>

<p>“This new Web site helps encourage and manage the development of more great add-ons for Firefox, and enables users to customize their browsing experience to make Firefox their own,” said Mike Shaver, director, ecosystem development, Mozilla. “The skills and knowledge of the Mozilla developer community will now be applied to the development, testing and support of add-ons. That means better add-ons for users, and more ways for businesses and organizations to integrate their services into Firefox.”</p>

<p>Firefox add-ons enable users to customize their browser with powerful, fun and useful tools that give them total control over the appearance and functionality of their browser. Add-ons help make Firefox the most personalized browser available to Internet users. More than 7 million Firefox users currently have add-ons installed on their browser.</p>

<ul>
<li>User reviews and ratings for add-ons</li>
<li>Improved search to help Firefox users find the perfect add-on</li>
<li>Language support for Danish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Romanian, Russian, Slovakian, and Spanish users, with more languages to come</li>
<li>New tools and support for add-on developers, and the ability to harness the power of the Mozilla community in add-on development</li>
<li>A new level of testing for add-ons that ensures even higher quality and functionality for users</li>
</ul>

<p>For developers, Mozilla has expanded the Firefox Add-ons Web site to include detailed information about creating, supporting and distributing add-ons to Firefox users. Just as the Firefox Web browser is developed, tested and supported by the Mozilla community, add-ons will now benefit from the expertise of Mozilla developers from around the world. The Mozilla community will provide code review, feature testing and even usability feedback for add-on developers. The community will also recommend favorite add-ons to help users find the best of the thousands of free extensions and themes.</p>

<p>Hundreds of developers are already creating great Firefox add-ons, including: AdaptiveBlue, AllPeers, del.ici.ous, FoxMarks, Pronto, StumbleUpon, and many more.</p>
