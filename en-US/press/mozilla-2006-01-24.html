<h2>Firefox 1.5 Adoption Rising as Browser Garners Acclaim</h2>
<p class="sub-title">CNET, PC Magazine, PC Pro and PC Professionell award Mozilla's Firefox top honors</p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - January 24, 2006 - Firefox 1.5 is off to a blazing start. Since its release on November 29, 2005, over twenty million people have chosen the better Web experience Firefox 1.5 delivers, featuring enhanced speed, security and simplicity. Demand has been strong, with hundreds of thousands of people downloading the new version of Firefox each and every day since its release. Firefox is quickly spreading worldwide, with over 35 local language versions available as free downloads from <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">www.getfirefox.com</a>.</p>

<p>CNET has awarded Firefox 1.5 its Editor&#8217;s Choice award, which recognizes outstanding computing and electronics products that CNET editors have determined represent the highest quality, design, and service to users. Firefox has received two awards from PC Magazine: the Technical Excellence Award and the Best of 2005 Award. Firefox also garnered recognition from UK-based PC Pro and received the publication&#8217;s Real World Computing Award, and was chosen as the &#8220;Editor&#8217;s Choice&#8221; from German-based PC Professionell. </p>

<h3>Not just a pretty interface</h3>

<p>Firefox 1.5 users enjoy a sleek user interface, automated update system, enhanced tabbed-browsing and privacy options, as well as access to more than 900 extensions that enable users to customize the browser to fit their needs. </p>

<p>&#8220;We are extremely pleased to see strong worldwide demand for Firefox 1.5,&#8221; said Christopher Beard, vice president of products, at Mozilla Corp. &#8220;The recognition Firefox has received from such highly respected outlets as CNET, PC Magazine, PC Pro, and PC Professionell is a huge compliment to our worldwide community of open source contributors and consumer advocates who make Firefox possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>To accelerate the adoption of Firefox, Mozilla has recently unveiled the second phase of &#8220;Firefox Flicks,&#8221; its community-driven marketing campaign for the browser. The Firefox Flicks Ad Contest encourages professionals, students, and aspiring creatives in film and TV production, Web design, advertising and animation to submit high-quality 30-second ads about the browser. This contest builds on the first phase of the campaign, which encouraged Firefox users worldwide to submit video testimonials about their experience with Firefox. The Firefox Flicks campaign continues the innovative approach to grassroots marketing that began with the user-driven two page New York Times ad in Nov. 2004 for the launch of Firefox 1.0. Information about Firefox Flicks is available online at <a href="http://www.firefoxflicks.com">www.firefoxflicks.com.</a></p>
