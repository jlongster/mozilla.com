<h2>Mozilla Launches Firefox Flicks Ad Contest</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Grassroots Marketing Campaign Taps Into the Creative Energy of Amateur and Pro Filmmakers to Introduce Firefox to an Even Wider Audience</p>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Dec. 22, 2005 - Mozilla Corp. today announced the opening of the Firefox Flicks Ad Contest, which calls for submissions of 30-second ads for Firefox from professional, student, and aspiring filmmakers. Building upon the adoption of the award-winning Web browser, Firefox 1.5, by over 10 million Web users worldwide in less than one month since its release, the Ad Contest continues Mozilla's tradition of empowering its community of users to spread the word about Firefox. Tens of thousands of volunteer supporters congregate regularly at Mozilla's community marketing Web site, SpreadFirefox.com, to coordinate global grassroots marketing initiatives for Firefox.</p>

<p> Earlier this month, Mozilla unveiled the first phase of the Firefox Flicks campaign: a Testimonials Web site where Firefox users can record video testimonials and tell others why Firefox provides a better Web experience. To date, several dozen testimonials from over 20 different countries have been published to the Web site, with many more recorded each day. Testimonials may be viewed at <a href="http://www.firefoxflicks.com">www.firefoxflicks.com</a>. </p>


<p> Launched today, the Firefox Flicks Ad Contest calls upon professional, student and aspiring filmmakers to join the growing community of Firefox contributors to create innovative, broadcast-quality 30-second commercials for Firefox. The ads will be judged by a star-studded panel of luminaries drawn from the film, television and advertising industries, with great prizes up for grabs. The winning ads will also be considered for inclusion in global marketing campaigns for Firefox. </p>

<p> The panel of judges -- Firefox fans from across the creative industry -- includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jim Denault, cinematographer (Six Feet Under, Carnivale, Maria Full of Grace)</li>
<li>McG, director/producer (Charlie's Angels, The OC, Supernatural)</li>
<li>Scott Goodson, CEO of Strawberry Frog ad agency (Old Navy, IKEA, MTV)</li>
<li>Freddy Rodriguez, actor (Six Feet Under)</li>
<li>Geo Santini, director (Partners)</li>
<li>Ben Younger, director/writer (Prime, Boiler Room)</li>
<li>Warren Zide, producer (American Pie, Final Destination)</li>
</ul>
