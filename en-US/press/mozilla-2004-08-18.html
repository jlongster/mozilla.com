<h2>Mozilla Affiliate in Japan Kicks Off</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Mozilla Japan to promote adoption of Mozilla products</p>
<p>
August 18, 2004 (the Internet)&nbsp; - The Mozilla Foundation and
Mozilla Japan today announced the launch of the Mozilla-Japan.org web
site and the creation of Mozilla Japan, a non-profit organization that
will promote, develop and help deploy Mozilla products in Japan.</p>
Mozilla Japan will focus on a number of critical efforts:<br />
<ul>
  <li>The organization will work on the internationalization and
localization of Mozilla products and will be responsible for official
Japanese localized versions of Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird and the
Mozilla 1.7 Internet suite. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Mozilla Japan will contribute to the development of Mozilla
technologies.</li>
  <li>Local experts will assist in the deployment of Mozilla products
and provide support to both end users and enterprises.</li>
  <li>Mozilla Japan will cultivate and assist Mozilla business partners
and educate local users about Mozilla products.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to end user programs, Mozilla Japan will offer a wide range of
services aimed at bolstering enterprise adoption of Mozilla products in Japan.  These services include product deployment assistance, migration support and technical assistance and advice on making web sites standards-compliant.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to support the creation of Mozilla Japan," said
Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla Foundation. "Japan has a
large concentration of Mozilla users, and Mozilla Japan will play a
vital role in ensuring that our Japanese users have access to the
highest quality products and to the full range of services needed for
broad end-user and enterprise adoption.&nbsp; We are especially
thankful for the leadership and resources that have been provided by
Ten Art-ni, without which this endeavor would not have been possible."</p>
<p>
The board of directors of Mozilla Japan is chaired by Hideo Aiso
(President of the prestigious Tokyo University of Technology), and
includes Professor Hideyuki Tokuda (of Keio University), Nobuo Kita
(CEO of Ten Art-ni Corporation), Satoko Takita (formerly of AOL/Netscape
Japan), and Motohiro Egota (of Ten Art-ni).&nbsp; Ten Art-ni, a
publicly traded company, is the leading provider of open source
solutions in Japan. </p>
<p>
The Mozilla-japan.org web site reflects the strong local community of
Mozilla developers who contribute their expertise to the localization
of Firefox, Thunderbird and the Mozilla 1.7 Internet suite.&nbsp; The web site
is available at <a href="http://www.mozilla-japan.org">http://www.mozilla-japan.org</a>.</p>
