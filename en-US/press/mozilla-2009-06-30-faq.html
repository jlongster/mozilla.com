<dl class="faq">

<dt>Q: When is Firefox 3.5 available?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Firefox 3.5 is available now for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X operating systems as a free download from <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">http://www.getfirefox.com</a>.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: What’s new in Firefox 3.5?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Firefox 3.5 is the best performing browser Mozilla has ever released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance, new privacy controls, native support for open video and audio, and Location Aware Browsing. The newest version of Firefox is more than two times faster than Firefox 3 and ten times faster than Firefox 2.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: How does Firefox 3.5 speed up performance?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Firefox 3.5 includes the new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine. The TraceMonkey engine enables new kinds of Web applications by compiling code as you execute it, allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed. With Firefox 3.5, Web applications like email, photo editors, online word processors and more feel snappier and more responsive.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: Do I have to do anything to set-up the audio/video feature in Firefox 3.5?</dt>
<dd><p>A: You can enjoy video and audio content from within your browser, without the need for plugins. Video is a vital part of the modern Web, whether it’s used to communicate, educate, or entertain. Firefox 3.5 delivers the first native integration of audio and video directly into the browser. You can easily watch open format Ogg Theora videos. Web developers can use these technologies to design pages that interact with video content in new and exciting ways, offering richer interactive experiences beyond controlling playback and volume. </p></dd>


<dt>Q: What is “Location Aware Browsing”? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Location Aware Browsing will save you time by allowing websites to ask you where you are. It’s all optional – Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission. If you choose to share your location with a website, it can use that information to find nearby points of interest and return additional, useful data like maps of your area.</p>
<p>For specific questions about the Location Aware Browsing feature you can find out more at: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/geolocation/">http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/geolocation/</a> and the privacy policy from the Google Location Service: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy-lsf.html">http://www.google.com/privacy-lsf.html</a></p></dd>

<h3>CUSTOMIZATION</h3>

<dl class="faq">

<dt>Q: How can I customize Firefox 3.5?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Firefox is the most customizable browser on the planet. With a growing library of more than 6,000 free Firefox add-ons, little extras you download and install for a browser that works your way. Manage online auctions, upload digital photos, see the weather forecast in a glance and listen to music all within Firefox. If you’re not sure where to begin, try Fashion Your Firefox—a handy Web application that recommends add-ons based on your interests. Get it at: <a href="http://www.fashionyourfirefox.com">http://www.fashionyourfirefox.com</a></p></dd>


<dt>Q: Will my add-ons work with Firefox 3.5?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Many add-ons are already compatible with Firefox 3.5. In Firefox 3.5, add-ons can be installed only if they can be securely updated. Firefox automatically checks the installed versions of add-ons and alerts you if new versions are available. Also, Mozilla can disable add-ons and plugins that are known to introduce a privacy or security concern.</p></dd>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<dl class="faq">

<dt>Q: How does the Private Browsing mode work in Firefox 3.5?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Suppose you’re shopping for a surprise gift, so you don’t want the sites you’ve been viewing stored in your browser’s history. You can enter private browsing mode by going to Tools->Start Private Browsing. A simple dialog screen confirms you’ve entered this mode and nothing you encounter on the Web will be recorded from that moment on: none of the websites you visit and none of the cookies you collect will be saved. Exit private browsing mode through the Tools menu again and you’re back to normal browsing.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: What if I forget to enter Private Browsing mode and want Firefox to forget the website I just visited?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Firefox 3.5 includes a new feature – Forget this Site – where you can remove every trace of that site from your browser—no questions asked! Open the History Sidebar from the View menu, select a website and then select Forget This Site from the right-click menu. </p>
<p>You can also clear all your private data or just your activity over the past few hours with a few quick clicks with Firefox 3.5’s improved Clear Recent History feature. With Firefox 3.5 you have full control over what to delete and that information is gone for good—on your own computer or the one at your local library. You can find this feature in the Tools menu.</p>
</dd>


<dt>Q: How often do you release updates?</dt>
<dd><p>A: We release a stability and security update approximately every six to eight weeks, which is delivered through Firefox’s automatic update feature. We are also committed to issuing patches if a vulnerability is discovered that warrants an immediate response outside of our regular schedule. Browser security is ever evolving and new potential vulnerabilities are regularly discovered by our dedicated team of researchers as part of our Quality Assurance process.</p>

<p>Security updates are standard and critical to providing users with the experience they have come to trust.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: Traditional software companies take much longer to issue updates – how are you able to turn them around so quickly?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Mozilla has hundreds of contributors that are involved in creating and distributing these security updates. These contributors are passionate about producing the safest and most secure software available.</p>

<p>At the heart of Firefox is a global, open source development process driven by a large community of passionate contributors: thousands of experienced developers, security experts, localization and support communities in more than 60 countries, and tens of thousands of active testers. Our transparency and active community of experts help to ensure our products are more secure and are updated quickly.</p></dd>
