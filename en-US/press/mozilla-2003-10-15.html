<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION LAUNCHES NEW WEB BROWSER AND END USER SERVICES</h2>

<p class="sub-title">Mozilla
1.5, a new Web site, end user support, CD program, and technology preview
releases signal increased end user focus</p>

<p>

Mountain
View, CA, October 15, 2003 - Three months after it was created, the Mozilla
Foundation, the organization that shepherds the open source Mozilla project,
announced a series of new products and services aimed at meeting the needs of
end users. Today, the organization
released version 1.5 of the Mozilla Web browsing suite and technology previews
of its next generation Web browser and e-mail clients.
In a move aimed at better serving
consumers, the Mozilla Foundation also announced the availability of
affordably-priced CDs, telephone customer support and unveiled a new Web site
that showcases Mozilla's support for industry Web standards.
</p>

<p>Now
that we are an independent organization, we will continue to aggressively
develop our core technologies, but we will also focus more heavily on serving
end users,&quot; said Mitchell Baker, president of the Mozilla
Foundation. &quot;The services and products we're announcing today mark
the beginning of this effort and are part of our plan for ensuring the
long-term success and viability of the Mozilla project.&quot;
</p>

<h2>Mozilla 1.5 Released</h2>

Best of 2003 in its category, is available for immediate download from

software are also available.
Mozilla 1.5 makes surfing the Internet a safer, more enjoyable
experience with features such as blocking of pop-up advertisements, tabbed

sophisticated spam controls. The
Internet suite includes a Web browser, e-mail client, Web page design software

built-in spell-checker. Numerous
improvements were made to Mozilla Composer, Mozilla's
GUI Web editor, including a &quot;snap to grid&quot; feature and better
resizing of images, tables and absolutely positioned objects.
Additionally, lots of bugfixes and new
features were added to Chatzilla, the Mozilla chat client.

Mozilla Foundation also unveiled a redesigned Web site that aims to meet the
needs of end users and developers alike.

community support message boards.
