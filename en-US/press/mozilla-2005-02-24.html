<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES UPDATE TO FIREFOX</h2>
<p class="sub-title">All Firefox users are encouraged to download security update at mozilla.org</p>
<p>
February 24, 2005, (Mountain View, CA). The Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving choice and promoting innovation on the Internet, today released an update to its award-winning Firefox 1.0 browser. The Firefox security update is available for the 27 million users who have already downloaded the free browser. The Mozilla Foundation encourages all users to download the update, which is available now on all platforms at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">www.mozilla.org</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Regular security updates are essential for maintaining a safe browsing experience for our users," said Chris Hofmann, director of engineering for the Mozilla Foundation. "The Mozilla Foundation has developed a community of users and developers who continuously provide feedback on Mozilla software, and as a result of that constant vigilance, we are able to provide quick and effective responses to security vulnerabilities."
</p>
<p>
The Mozilla Foundation evaluates security issues on an ongoing basis and will issue security updates as warranted. The security update for Firefox includes several fixes to guard against spoofing and arbitrary code execution. More information is available in the release notes at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/">http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/</a>.
</p>
<p>
Firefox has been widely praised for its stability, trustworthiness and innovative features including tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, built-in pop-up blocking, and hundreds of available extensions. SC Magazine, a leading security magazine, recently awarded the Mozilla Foundation with its Editor in Chief award. The browser has been downloaded more than 27 million times and is available in 28 languages.
