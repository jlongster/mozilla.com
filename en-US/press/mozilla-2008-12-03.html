<h1>Mozilla And Zazzle Announce Strategic Relationship For Apparel On-Demand</h1>
<p><em>Partnership enables Mozilla community to create a variety of apparel for their favorite Firefox fans and others</em></p>

<p>Redwood City, CA and Mountain View, CA – December 4, 2008 – Mozilla, a public-benefit organization dedicated to promoting choice and innovation on the Internet, and Zazzle, the leading on-demand retail platform for consumers and major brands, today announced a strategic relationship for apparel on-demand. Through the relationship, Zazzle will host a special Mozilla community store featuring an array of community-generated designs on a variety of apparel for purchase, with full customization.</p>

<p>“The open web and open source are very much about remixing things and mashing them up to express yourself,” said Mark Surman, Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation. "The community store is about exactly this. It's an expression of our philosophy and a new way for community members to get involved.”</p>

<p>The Mozilla Community Store (<a href="http://communitystore.mozilla.org">http://communitystore.mozilla.org</a>) will link to Zazzle, making it possible for anyone to design Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Camino, Bugzilla, Sunbird or Lightning apparel for purchase. Designs consist entirely of artwork supplied by Mozilla's worldwide community, with all designs available for customization on over 400 apparel products including t-shirts, sweatshirts and tank tops.</p>

<p>“Mozilla’s active community is a perfect fit for the Zazzle platform,” said Bobby Beaver, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Zazzle. “People want to interact with brands they love, and our platform makes this easy while remaining true to the user experience, and the brand. We’re excited to empower the Mozilla community at Zazzle.”</p>

<p>The Zazzle experience is intuitive; users simply choose their design and select apparel type, customize it to their liking if so inclined and purchase. For Firefox fans looking to create their own apparel, they simply upload their image, create the product and purchase. Prices start at $15 with most products being produced on-demand and within 24 hours of ordering.</p>

<p>In support of the launch, Zazzle will be offering 20% off shirts through December 25th. Enter the special promo code MOZILLAMERCH at check out for the discount.</p>
