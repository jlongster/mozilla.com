In Firefox 3, you can view and install add-ons directly from the browser. Access the Add-ons Manager by clicking on Tools->Add-ons. The Mozilla community at addons.mozilla.org helps you select the right add-on through ratings, recommendations, descriptions, and images.

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<dd><p>A: Firefox 3 raises the bar for security. New malware and improved anti-phishing protection helps keep you safer from viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware on the Internet. Firefox 3’s one-click site ID information checks on suspicious sites and avoids Web forgeries to ensure a site is what it claims to be. Mozilla’s open source process leverages the experience of thousands of security experts around the globe.  You can learn more here: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/security/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/security/</a></p></dd>


<dt>Q: What's the passport guy doing in the browser? Who is "Larry"?</dt>
<dd><p>A: Larry is the friendly Passport Officer who helps you determine whom you're dealing with online.  He helps you see at a glance whether the Web site you’re visiting has supplied information about its identity, which organization verified that information, and whether they protect your information from eavesdroppers.

You can learn more about Larry and what he's doing to keep you safe online here: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/security/identity/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/security/identity/</a>.</p></dd>

<p>Security updates are standard and critical to providing users with the experience they have come to trust.</p></dd>


<dt>Q: Traditional software companies take much longer to issue updates – how are you able to turn them around so quickly?</dt>
