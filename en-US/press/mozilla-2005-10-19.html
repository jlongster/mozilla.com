<h2>Firefox Surpasses 100 Million Downloads!</h2>
<p>
<strong>October 19, 2005, (Mountain View, CA)</strong>. The Mozilla Corp. extends 100 million "Thank you's" to <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com">Firefox community members</a> for reigniting innovation on the Web. As the browser's first anniversary approaches this November, Firefox adoption numbers have exceeded expectations with more than 100 million downloads since Firefox's introduction in 2004.</p>
<p>
Firefox's download success is a direct result of the collaborative efforts of thousands of contributors worldwide. Their work developing and fine-tuning the Firefox browser ensures the best Web experience available. Volunteer extension developers further enrich Firefox's capabilities by enabling users to customize and enhance their browser and truly take back the Web.  
</p>

<p>
Mozilla also congratulates the members of the Spread Firefox community for their success in reigniting the Web by driving the popularity of the browser. Their global grassroots efforts have set a new standard for software marketing and played a significant role in helping Firefox to achieve this amazing milestone.  Stay tuned as the <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com">Spread Firefox community</a> launches an even more innovative campaign for the upcoming Firefox 1.5 release later this Fall.
</p>

<p>
Asa Dotzler, liaison for the Spread Firefox community explained, "Our community of more than 100,000 Firefox developers, testers, and grassroots marketers, is rejuvenating Web browsing, which is why millions of new users make the jump to Firefox every week. Spread Firefox members look forward to the next 100 million downloads as they mobilize for the exciting new release of Firefox 1.5." 
</p>

<p>
Mozilla looks forward to the continued adoption of the Firefox browser around the world and thanks the community for helping make history!
