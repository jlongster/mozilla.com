<h2>MOZILLA FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES BETA RELEASE OF XFORMS 1.0 RECOMMENDATION</h2>
<p>
February 2, 2005, (Mountain View, CA). The Mozilla Foundation today
announced the beta release of the W3C's XForms 1.0 Recommendation.  XForms
is the forms module standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C), which enables developers to deliver the type of next-generation,
rich, portable web-based applications desired by corporate IT. 
</p>
<p>
Developed in collaboration with IBM, Novell, and the open source community,
XForms technology is now available as an extension to the Mozilla 1.8 and
Firefox 1.1 web browsers which are currently under development. This
release is intended for users in non-production environments who are
interested in exploring XForms 1.0 technology ahead of the extension's
general availability release later this year. The extension is available
for Linux, Windows, and Macintosh platforms. Beta user feedback on this
release is highly encouraged.  Please consult the beta release notes for
information on known limitations and how to provide beta feedback.
</p>
<p>

project, please visit the project page at
