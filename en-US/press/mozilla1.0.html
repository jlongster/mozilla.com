MOZILLA.ORG LAUNCHES MOZILLA 1.0

Open Source Browser Suite Powered by Gecko Enables Developers 
To Create Standards-Based Web Applications and Devices  
</b>


MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - June 5, 2002 - Mozilla.org, the organization 
that coordinates Mozilla open-source development and provides services 
to assist the Mozilla community, today announced the release of Mozilla 1.0, 
the first major-version public release of the Mozilla software. A full-fledged
browser suite based on the latest Internet standards as well as a 
cross-platform toolkit, Mozilla 1.0 is targeted at the developer community 
and enables the creation of Internet-based applications. Mozilla 1.0 was 
developed in an open source environment and built by harnessing the creative 
power of thousands of programmers and tens of thousands of testers on the 
Internet, incorporating their best enhancements. 

Built on the Gecko layout engine, Mozilla 1.0 is cross-platform and 
integrates a core set of applications that allow users to access the 
capabilities of the Web, including a web browser, an email reader and a 
chat client. Gecko is the core browser component in Mozilla 1.0 and was 
developed as part of the mozilla.org open source project; it is freely 
available for inclusion in third party products. Mozilla 1.0 uses Gecko 
to deliver the most advanced, standards-compliant browser across platforms; 
the ease of embedding Gecko brings the same power to desktop applications 
as well as devices. The release of Mozilla 1.0 signals a new level of 
compatibility and maturity of the programming interfaces provided by Gecko, 
and paves the way for the arrival of new Gecko-based products.

In addition, Mozilla 1.0 is a cross-platform toolkit for developing 
Internet-based applications. By offering a set of components that can be 
used in a wide range of applications, are all open source, free of charge 
and have been tested through their use in Mozilla 1.0's end-user applications,
Mozilla 1.0 enables developers to build applications for a cross-platform, 
network-centric world. Mozilla 1.0 also expands the range of developers who 
can write complex applications since Mozilla's architecture enables the 
creation of such complex applications by building upon the same technologies 
that are used to create web content. For instance, Gecko displays web content 
on the user's screen and parses and renders HTML and XML content, and this 
ability to understand and display HTML and XML is valuable in numerous 
applications beyond the browser. In addition, Mozilla's cross-platform 
component implementation, Mozilla's cross-platform XML-based user-interface 
development technology ("XUL"), its networking libraries, its ECMAScript 
(JavaScript) implementation, and its security and encryption libraries are 
all part of the Mozilla 1.0 cross-platform toolkit for application 
development.  

"Mozilla.org is excited about releasing the Mozilla 1.0 code and development 
tools to the open source community, and providing developers with the 
resources they need to freely create and view the presentation of their 
content and data on the Web," said Mitchell Baker, Chief Lizard Wrangler at 
mozilla.org. "As the browser has become the main interface between users and 
the Web over the past several years, the goal of the Mozilla project is to 
innovate and enable the creation of standards-compliant technology to keep 
content on the Web open. As more and more programmers and companies are 
embracing Mozilla as a strategic technology, Mozilla 1.0 signals the advent 
of even further dissemination and adoption of open source and standards-based 
software across the Web." 

"The Mozilla project has quietly become a key building block in the open 
source infrastructure. In addition to the open source Mozilla browser and 
the Netscape 7.0 browser, the Mozilla toolkit has been used to create 
additional browsers for platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X, instant 
messaging clients such as Chatzilla and the cross-platform Jabber client, 
and software development tools such as ActiveState's Komodo IDE," said 
Tim O'Reilly, Founder and CEO, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. "Moreover, there 
are over 70 distinct projects hosted at mozdev.org, the community site for 
Mozilla derivatives. This industry-wide momentum ought to be considered a 
major success in anyone's book."

"The release of Mozilla 1.0 represents a huge milestone for the free 
software community.  From browser technology to software development tools, 
the Mozilla project has had an enormous impact on open source development," 
said Nat Friedman, Vice President of Product Development at Ximian Inc. 
"Most importantly, Mozilla 1.0 is a key part of an industrial-strength open 
source desktop."

"The launch of Mozilla 1.0 is a key event for embedders across the Web, it 
gives us a stable platform to develop upon in addition to guaranteed APIs to 
build applications with," added Philip Langdale, Mozilla interfacing code 
maintainer for the Galeon web browser project. "We would like to congratulate 
the entire mozilla.org team for producing such an outstanding product, as 
key open source projects including Galeon would not have reached this level 
of quality or maturity without their hard work." 

By virtue of embedding Gecko, Mozilla 1.0 and products based on Mozilla code 
support more web standards, more deeply, more consistently across more 
platforms than any others. Mozilla 1.0 features full support for HTML 4.0, 
XML 1.0, Resource Description Framework (RDF), Cascading Style Sheets level 1 
(CSS1), and the W3C Document Object Model level 1 (DOM1). Mozilla 1.0 also 
has the industry's best support for Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 (CSS2), 
the Document Object Model Level 2 (DOM2), and XHTML. Standards support also 
includes XML data exchange and manipulation of XML documents with SOAP 1.1, 
XSLT, XPath 1.0, and FIXptr, as well as support for display of mathematical 
equations using MathML. Finally, it features a solid foundation of support 
for data transport protocols (HTTP, FTP, and SSL/TLS), multilingual character 
data (Unicode), graphics (GIF, JPEG, PNG and MNG) and the latest version of 
the world's most popular scripting language, JavaScript 1.5. 

Further, Mozilla has been designed for easy localization into languages 
other than English, and localized versions of Mozilla 1.0 will be available 
in the following languages (with more to follow): Asturian, Chinese, Dutch, 
Estonian, Galician, German, Georgian, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, 
Malay, Polish, Slovak, Sorbian and Ukrainian. (For further details, please

Mozilla will celebrate the release of Mozilla 1.0 with a party at the DNA 
Lounge in San Francisco at 8pm on Wednesday, June 12, 2002. Details are 
available at <a href="http://mozilla.org/party/2002/flyer.html">http://mozilla.org/party/2002/flyer.html</a>.  Additional parties 
are also being planned by Mozilla participants at 126 locations worldwide.
