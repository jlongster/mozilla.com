<h2>Mozilla Launches Firefox Flicks Campaign</h2>
<p class="sub-title">Two-Pronged Global Campaign Reaches Out to Avid Firefox Fans and Creative Professionals Alike</p>
<p>
<strong>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.</strong> - Dec. 2, 2005 – In conjunction with the release of Firefox 1.5, the latest version of the acclaimed open source Web browser, Mozilla Corp. today also announced Firefox Flicks.  
</p>
<p>Firefox Flicks will showcase the widespread adoption of Firefox among Web users, and builds upon the success of grassroots marketing efforts for Firefox 1.0, including a community-sponsored two-page ad in The New York Times that ran November 2004. Firefox Flicks is a key part of Mozilla's ongoing community-driven, open source marketing efforts, organized online at SpreadFirefox.com. Firefox Flicks is the first in a planned series of marketing campaigns Mozilla will be rolling out in the coming months to drive worldwide adoption of Firefox.
</p>
<p>Firefox Flicks is being rolled out in two stages – the first invites Firefox users to record a video testimonial about Firefox. The second, details of which will be announced in mid- December, is aimed at creative professionals and students. The Firefox Flicks Ad Contest is focused on promoting the creation of innovative 30-second ads about Firefox. The best Testimonials and Ads will be incorporated into Mozilla’s global marketing campaign for Firefox. </p>

<p>"Our success has been driven by satisfied users letting other people know they are having a better Web experience with Firefox. Firefox Flicks taps into the creative energy and enthusiasm of our community to tell the world in their own words why they love Firefox," said Christopher Beard, VP, Products, at Mozilla Corp."</p>
