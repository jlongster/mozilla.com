<h2>Mozilla Releases Preview of Application Framework for Development of
Cross-Platform Internet Client Applications</h2>

<p>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - February 3, 2006 - Mozilla today released a developer preview of its application framework, code-named XULRunner, that aids in the rapid development and deployment of cross-platform applications.</p>

<p>XULRunner provides a base for software application authors to
leverage familiar Internet technologies, the Mozilla XUL user-
interface language, and the same networking and rendering engine as
Firefox to develop rich-client applications, such as media players,
Web authoring tools and IP-based phones, which can run on any
operating system.</p>

<p>XULRunner contains features developed in conjunction with IBM which
allow the Eclipse development environment, a vendor-neutral open
development platform and application framework for building software,
to display, develop, and debug Web technologies such as HTML, XML and
JavaScript. Future versions of Firefox will also be built on  
XULRunner.</p>

<p>
Projects including Nvu, Songbird, WengoPhone, and ZAP are developing
software based on Mozilla technology through this new application
framework.</p>

<p>
The release announced today is a stable developer preview, based on
the same code base as Firefox 1.5.0.1. Additional features such as an
installer and an application deployment framework are planned for
future releases. XULRunner downloads and additional information about
XULRunner are available from the Mozilla Developer Center at <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner">http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner</a>.
