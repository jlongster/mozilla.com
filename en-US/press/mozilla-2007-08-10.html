<h3>What:</h3>
<p>&quot;Mozilla 24&quot; is a worldwide, 24-hour open discussion that connects community members, academics and Web visionaries from Asia, America and Europe, in person and over the broadband video WIDE network. The event will feature industry leaders who will present on Web trends and technologies that will help shape the future of the Web.</p>
<p>Current speakers include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dr. Vint Cerf, Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist at Google Inc.</li>
  <li>Dr. Lawrence Lessig, professor of law at Stanford Law School and founder of its Center for Internet and Society</li>

<p>&quot;Mozilla 24&quot; consists of a variety of programs, including presentations, panel discussions, online contests, and music festivals.  Many of the presentations, including the panel discussions, will be accessible online to anyone in the world using the distance learning environment and remotely placed virtual machines provided by the WIDE Project’s School on the Internet Working Group (SOI), a research consortium that operates its own IP backbone and the M-Root Server. For example, Keio University and Stanford University will facilitate a distance panel discussion among Dr. Vint Cerf, Dr. Jun Murai and Mitchell Baker, using DVTS high-definition video and advanced data technologies. This panel will mark the inaugural connection between Keio University’s Global Studio and that of Stanford University which was established as a part of DMC Research Institute's Global Studio initiative.
