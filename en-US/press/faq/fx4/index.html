          <li>
            The Content Security Policy (CSP) in Firefox prevents
            cross-site scripting attacks. It does this by providing a
            mechanism for sites to explicitly tell the browser which
            content is legitimate. The browser can then disregard any
            content not blessed by the site.

          the Mozilla Audio API to help create visual experiences for

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/sync/">Firefox
        Sync</a> is integrated into Firefox, giving you access to your
        Awesome Bar history, bookmarks, open tabs and passwords across
        computers and mobile devices. The new Firefox Sync user
        interface also makes it even easier to set up, helping go from
        work to home to mobile and back with ease.

    <dt>Why does Firefox look different than it used to?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We updated the default look of Firefox to compliment the way
        people use the Web today. The new look makes it easier to
        focus on Web content and to control your Firefox tools.

        <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2010/06/24/why-tabs-are-on-top-in-firefox-4/">this
        blog post</a> explains what we did to streamline the interface
        and why tabs are on top of the Awesome Bar by default in
        Firefox 4.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I still customize the user interface?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The Firefox user-interface (UI) remains completely
        customizable. You can switch the locations of tabs and whether
        or not a menu bar, bookmark bar or status bar is visible.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How else can I customize Firefox?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We have a growing gallery of more than 200,000 add-ons to
        customize the features, functionality and look of Firefox. The
        Add-ons Manager helps you discover, install, and update
        add-ons without having to restart Firefox and lets you easily
        view, manage and disable third-party plugins. Mozilla can
        disable add-ons and plug-ins that are known to introduce a
        privacy or security concern.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Are my Firefox Add-ons compatible with Firefox 4?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        More than 75 percent of add-ons are already compatible with
        Firefox 4. Firefox will automatically let you know which
        add-ons are compatible in the Add-ons Manager.

    <dt>Where can I get a quick overview of Firefox 4?</dt>

    <dt>How did stability improve in Firefox 4?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash
        in the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight
        plugins. If one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or
        freezes, it will not affect the rest of the page or
        Firefox. You can simply reload the page to restart the plugin
        and try again.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How did performance improve in Firefox 4?</dt>
    <dd>

        This is the fastest Firefox ever, up to six times faster than
        the previous release. With improved start-up and page load

        Mozilla Firefox puts your privacy first. Firefox 4 builds on
        the existing ways to protect your privacy in previous
        releases, including browser privacy controls and private
        browsing mode. Firefox 4 introduces the following privacy and
        security improvements:
