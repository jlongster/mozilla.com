            content is legitimate. The browser can then disregard any

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/sync/">Firefox
        Sync</a> is integrated into Firefox, giving you access to your
        Awesome Bar history, bookmarks, open tabs and passwords across
        computers and mobile devices. The new Firefox Sync user
        interface also makes it even easier to set up, helping go from

    <dt>Why does Firefox look different than it used to?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We updated the default look of Firefox to compliment the way
        people use the Web today. The new look makes it easier to
        focus on Web content and to control your Firefox tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more details,
        <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2010/06/24/why-tabs-are-on-top-in-firefox-4/">this
        blog post</a> explains what we did to streamline the interface
        and why tabs are on top of the Awesome Bar by default in
        Firefox.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I still customize the user interface?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The Firefox user-interface (UI) remains completely
        customizable. You can switch the locations of tabs and whether
        or not a menu bar, bookmark bar or status bar is visible.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How else can I customize Firefox?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We have a growing gallery of more than 200,000 add-ons to
        customize the features, functionality and look of Firefox. The
        Add-ons Manager helps you discover, install, and update
        add-ons without having to restart Firefox and lets you easily
        view, manage and disable third-party plugins. Mozilla can
        disable add-ons and plug-ins that are known to introduce a
        privacy or security concern.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Are my Firefox Add-ons compatible with Firefox?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Firefox will automatically let you know which
        add-ons are compatible in the Add-ons Manager.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How does Firefox improve stability?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash
        in the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight
        plugins. If one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or
        freezes, it will not affect the rest of the page or
        Firefox. You can simply reload the page to restart the plugin
        and try again.

    <dt>How does Firefox improve performance?</dt>

    <dt>How does Firefox protect my privacy and security?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Mozilla Firefox puts your privacy first. Firefox builds on
        the existing ways to protect your privacy in previous
        releases, including browser privacy controls and private
        browsing mode. Firefox introduces the following privacy and
        security improvements:
