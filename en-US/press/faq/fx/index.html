            The Content Security Policy (CSP) in Firefox prevents

            content is legitimate. The browser can then disregard any
            content not blessed by the site.

    <dd>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/sync/">Firefox
        Sync</a> is integrated into Firefox, giving you access to your
        Awesome Bar history, bookmarks, open tabs and passwords across
        computers and mobile devices. The new Firefox Sync user
        interface also makes it even easier to set up, helping go from

    <dt>Can I customize the user interface?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The Firefox user-interface (UI) remains completely
        customizable. You can switch the locations of tabs and whether
        or not a menu bar, bookmark bar or status bar is visible.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How else can I customize Firefox?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        We have a growing gallery of hundreds of thousands of add-ons 
        to customize the features, functionality and look of Firefox. 
        The Add-ons Manager helps you discover, install, and update 
        add-ons without having to restart Firefox and lets you easily 
        view, manage and disable third-party plugins. Mozilla can disable 
        add-ons and plug-ins that are known to introduce a 
        privacy or security concern.

    </dd>

    <dt>Are my Firefox Add-ons compatible with Firefox?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Firefox will automatically let you know which
        add-ons are compatible in the Add-ons Manager.

    </dd>

    <dt>How does Firefox improve stability?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash
        in the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight
        plugins. If one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or
        freezes, it will not affect the rest of the page or
        Firefox. You can simply reload the page to restart the plugin
        and try again.

      <p>
        Mozilla Firefox puts your privacy first. Firefox builds on 
        the existing ways to protect your privacy in previous 
        releases, including browser privacy controls and private 
        browsing mode. Firefox offers a Do Not Track feature that 
        lets you express a preference not to be tracked by websites.
