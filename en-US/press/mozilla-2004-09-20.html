<h2>MOZILLA FIREFOX PREVIEW RELEASE HITS ONE MILLION DOWNLOADS IN FIRST
FOUR DAYS OF AVAILABILITY</h2>
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - September 20, 2004 - The Mozilla Foundation
today announced there have been over one million downloads of Firefox
Preview Release in less than 100 hours, after being made available on
the Internet last Tuesday. As stated in the software's release last
week, The Mozilla Foundation set a lofty goal of one million downloads
in its first ten days of availability.&nbsp; This has been easily
eclipsed as users seeking a more trustworthy Internet experience
continue to use Mozilla's award winning Firefox web-browser.&nbsp; Over
7,500 individuals have also registered for Spreadfirefox.com to help
spread the word about Firefox to their friends, family, and co-workers.
<p>
"One million downloads for our preview release, in this short amount of
time, shows that interest in our products is reaching the mainstream
Internet audience, " said Mitchell Baker, President of the Mozilla
Foundation. "With this many downloads for the preview release, we are
looking forward to our final release of Firefox 1.0 in the next
Quarter."
<p>
In further recognition of the quality of the products, Mozilla
Foundation also announces that Firefox received the Editors' Choice
Award for Best Web Browser by LAPTOP Magazine in its October
edition.&nbsp; Also, the new Firefox Guidebook and CD which includes
Firefox Preview Release, Thunderbird 0.8, and Mozilla 1.7.3 are
available at the the Mozilla Store or http://store.mozilla.org.<br />
