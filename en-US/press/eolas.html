 <h1>Eolas Announcement</h1>
 <p>The Eolas matter highlights the degree to which web browser software is
  critical to the user experience of the web. It illustrates how
  technical choices in browser software determine the options available
  to more than 500 million web users.
 <p>The Eolas matter also demonstrates the interconnected nature
  of the web, where browser software interacts with plug-in software
  which interacts with actual content, and the combination of these
  elements is presented to the user. Effective solutions require shared
  standards, implemented by all and promoting interoperability. As
  always, the Mozilla Foundation will work toward the goal of a world
  wide web based on choice, standards-compliant alternatives and a great
  user experience.
 <p>Developers, site administrators, and business owners can visit the following web sites
  for help with updating sites containing everything from animations to
  rich Internet applications: 
  <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/activecontent/">http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/activecontent/</a>
  or 
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/ieembedfix.html">http://developer.apple.com/internet/ieembedfix.html</a>.
 <p>While we have not completed full testing of the various solutions proposed by
  Macromedia, Apple Computer and other vendors, these changes should be
  backwards compatible with today's current browsers and should work with
  Mozilla 1.4, Mozilla Firebird 0.6 and newer browsers.
