When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard,
product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the
function itself or the result of performing a function can be discerned
textually.</td>
      <td headers="tph2">Supports
with exceptions through equivalent facilitation:<br />

Keyboard equivalents for all actions are provided. </td>
      <td headers="tph3">Firefox supports all standard
keyboard operation of the user interface. Java and in-page plugins for
content such as Flash cannot be used with the keyboard so they must not
be installed for keyboard-only users. The tab order skips over them
completely, so form controls within them cannot be used without a mouse.<br />
      <br />
The "customize toolbar" dialog relies on drag-and-drop operations and
is therefore not accessible to keyboard-only users.  In practice, this
is not a problem, since toolbar buttons are not in the tab order.
All toolbar buttons have equivalent menu items which provide the
same functionality.<br />
      <br />

Full page plugins such as PDFs can be used if the option "Open with
default application" is used for each full page plugin type under Tools
-&gt; Options -&gt; Downloads -&gt; View and Edit actions. The "Open
with default application" preference is automatically set for screen
reader users.<br />

<br />
Special keyboard features in Firefox:
<ol>
<li>"Search for text when I start typing" allows for quick navigation to links and text
searching without opening a separate dialog.  This allows more
convenient use by screen magnification users because there is a single
point of regard for the search. It also assists users of input aids
because there are far fewer keys to type to get the desired location.
For example, it is possible to navigate to the desired link by pressing
2 letter keys rather than tabbing through many links to get there. </li>
<li>"Always use the cursor keys to navigate within web pages" allows
users to select arbitrary content with the
keyboard and move through web content as if inside a read-only editor. This
allows copying arbitrary pieces of text to the clipboard. The F7 key
toggles this feature on/off.</li>
<li>Tabbed browsing helps keyboard users by putting all of the browsed
documents in one Firefox application window rather than cluttering the
Alt+Tab order which makes keyboard navigation within the entire Windows
OS much simpler.</li>

<li>Both history and bookmarks can be searched with a "quick search"
field that quickly narrows the list down via a substring search.</li>
<li>Integrated web search (accessed by <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd>) is much faster to use than
going to the search tool's web site. Custom searches can be added to
this quick search bar and the user can switch between them by choosing
from a dropdown by pressing F4 or Alt+DownArrow.  Web sites can define
their own search interfaces, which appear in the dropdown while the user
is navigating the site.  The user can add these custom search
engines permanently by selecting "Add &lt;site-provided name&gt;" from
the dropdown.</li>

<li>Bookmarks can have a keyword assigned to them which can be typed
into the address bar to bring up the bookmark. A "smart keywords"
feature enhances this even further by allowing custom searches from the
command line such as "word punditry" to look up the word "punditry" in an online
dictionary. These smart keywords can be setup via the context menu for
the search field on the desired website.</li>
<li>The built-in full-page zoom feature can be accessed with the <kbd>Ctrl+plus</kbd>
and <kbd>Ctrl+minus</kbd> hotkeys.  <kbd>Ctrl+0</kbd> restores the text size to the default
author-provided size. Optionally, a text-only zoom can be enabled by selecting View -&gt; Zoom -&gt; Text Only.</li>

<li>The accessibility extension may be installed on top of Firefox,
allowing keyboard access to document structure.</li>

      <td headers="tph3">Certain events may trigger a
non-modal "notification bar" at the top of the window, for example when
Firefox blocks a popup window from opening automatically.  Each
notification has a defined importance level, for example "informational",
"warning", or "error".  The background of the notification bar indicates
the importance level.  The notification bar also includes an icon appropriate
for the importance level.  Furthermore, these notification bars and their
importance level are exposed to assistive technologies as an alert
(ROLE_SYSTEM_ALERT in MSAA), so an assistive technology can
programmatically determine the importance of the notification and
decide how to convey the text to the user.<br />
<br />

      Additional features: A distinction
between visited and unvisited links on web pages can be made without relying
