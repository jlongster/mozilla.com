    <h1>Firefox Community Beta Program</h1>

    <p>Youâ€™re part of the Firefox Community Beta Program! During the
       run up to Firefox 2, we released beta builds and 
       release candidates for wide testing and feedback as part of 
       a community beta program. Anyone who downloaded and installed 
       these pre-release versions of Firefox became part of this beta 
       program and was automatically updated to the Firefox 2 final
       release.</p>

    <p>To ensure the continued quality of Firefox 2, we have updated
       your Firefox to the latest pre-release version of the next
       security and stability update. We consider this release stable
       but are actively looking for new issues.</p>

    <p>If you are participating in this program, thanks for your 
       continued help. Please report any problems or issues at our
       community feedback web site at
       <a href="http://feedback.mozilla.org/">http://feedback.mozilla.org</a> 
       or through the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.feedback.firefox.prerelease">
       mozilla.feedback.firefox.prerelease</a> newsgroup.</p>

    <p>The final release of this version of Firefox will take place shortly
       after we complete wide testing through this program. All
       press inquiries should be directed to
       <a href="mailto:press@mozilla.com">press@mozilla.com</a>.</p>

    <p>To exclude yourself from the beta program, simply download and  
       install the latest stable production release of Firefox from
       <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">http://getfirefox.com</a>.</p>

      <p class="small-print">For details on what's included in this update,
         please see the <a href="../releasenotes/">release notes</a>.</p>
