      <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/system-requirements.html">
         system requirements</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="download">Downloading Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>
      <p>Mozilla.org provides Firefox&nbsp;2 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/all.html">get the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;2 here</a>.
         For builds for other systems and languages not provided by Mozilla.org, see
         the Contributed Builds section at the end of this document.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Firefox&nbsp;2 <em>will overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Firefox. You won't lose any of your bookmarks or
         browsing history, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might not work
         until updates for them are made available.</p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>

      <p>You can remove Firefox&nbsp;2 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Firefox</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>firefox</tt> folder on Linux.</p>
      <p>Removing Firefox&nbsp;2 won't remove your bookmarks, web browsing history,
         extensions or other add-ons. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows NT</td>
          <td>WINNT\Profiles\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 98, ME</td>
          <td>Windows\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>
          <td>~/.mozilla/firefox</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Firefox that you install after removing Firefox&nbsp;2 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

   <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under Firefox 1.5 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Firefox&nbsp;2. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension.  When you install Firefox&nbsp;2 all of your Extensions and Themes will be disabled until Firefox&nbsp;2 determines that either a) they are compatible with the Firefox&nbsp;2 release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible.</p>

      <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>

      <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Firefox&nbsp;2. Please read this before reporting any new bugs.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>All Systems</dt>
      <dd>
      <ul class="spaced">
      <li>Some firewall software may silently block Firefox from running. This often happens
          immediately after Firefox has been installed or updated from a previous version.
          There are <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firewalls">configuration instructions</a>
          available for most popular firewall programs to help you ensure that Firefox is
          allowed to connect to the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>Dictionaries for several locales can't be packaged with the builds, and must be
          manually downloaded by right-clicking in a text area and selecting "Add
          Dictionaries..." from the shortcut menu. New dictionaries are regularly being added
          to Mozilla Add-ons, so if you don't see the particular dictionary you need, check
          back later.
      </li>
      <li>When trying to print web pages with text areas, if the text area contains a misspelled
          word and spell checking is enabled, all the following content of the text area will
          not be printed. You can right-click in the text area and uncheck "Spell check this
          field" to turn off spell checking temporarily while you print.
      </li>
      <li>Access key definitions provided by web pages can now be triggered using Alt+Shift+key
          on Windows, Ctrl+key on Mac OS X, and Ctrl+Shift+key on Unix.
      </li>
      <li>The Session Restore functionality provided in Firefox&nbsp;2 will restore connections
          to services which use session cookies to maintain login state such as GMail. It is
          recommended that users with concerns about the privacy implications of this behavior
          change the value of <tt>browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash</tt> to false.
      </li>
      <li>The option for "Shrink to fit" has been removed in Firefox&nbsp;2. If you wish to change
          this from the value you had set in your previous version of Firefox, change the value
          of <tt>browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>To install Firefox on a multi-user system in a location in which users do not have
          write privileges, Firefox must be run at least once by a privileged user.
          Alternatively, an empty file must be created in the following directory: &lt;install-directory&gt;/extensions/talkback@mozilla.org/chrome.manifest
      </li>
      <li>Software Update will not work if Firefox is installed to a location on your disk
          to which you do not have write access, since Software Update needs to replace or
          create files in this location.
      </li>
      <li>Some financial institutions use port 563 for secure logins, which results in an
          error message. If you encounter this error, make sure that  <tt>network.security.ports.banned.override</tt> includes 563 in the comma-separated list of
          banned network ports to override.

      <ul class="spaced">
      <li>If the browser is installed in a non-default location, software updates may
          fail. You can reinstall the software to the default location, or to a
          non-default location as long as the install folder is named "Mozilla Firefox".
          Alternatively, you can start Firefox by right-clicking on its icon and
          selecting "Run as administrator" from the menu.
      </li>
      <li>When you launch the browser after it has downloaded a software update, you may
          get a dialog asking to permit "updater.exe" to run. If you do not allow this
          operation, the software update will fail.
      </li>
      <li>Firefox can not yet be set as the default browser on Vista. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352424">this bug</a> for more information.
      </li>
      <li>When installing as a restricted-access user on a shared machine into a location
          that you can write to, there may still be negative side effects (default
          browser/other keys not being set correctly). When installing as a restricted access user do <strong>not</strong>
          attempt to install over an existing installation in a restricted-access/shared location
          as this may destroy that installation.
      </li>
      <li>Firefox may hang when closing after viewing a PDF file in some older versions
          of the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug in. If you experience this, make sure you are
          using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">newest
          version</a> of the plug in.

      <li>Some users have reported problems viewing Macromedia Flash content on Intel Mac
          computers. To work around this problem, users can remove or move the PowerPC version
          of "Flash Player Enabler.plugin from <tt>/Library/Internet Plug-Ins</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>After installing a new plug-in, Firefox may continue to display information
          for the older version of the plug-in in about:plugins. If this happens, quit
          Firefox, delete the "pluginreg.dat" file from your <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder">profile folder</a>, and relaunch Firefox.

          <p>
            <code>touch .autoreg</code>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul class="spaced">

        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible Extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e. you installed it from a Web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install the extension globally.</p>
      <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the file.</p>

          Where can I get extensions and themes (add-ons)?
          <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/<?=$lang?>/firefox/extensions/">Extensions</a> and
             <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/<?=$lang?>/firefox/themes/">Themes</a> can be downloaded from
             <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/<?=$lang?>/firefox/">Firefox Add-ons</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Who makes Firefox&nbsp;2?
          <p>Lots of people. See Help-&gt;About Mozilla Firefox, Credits for a list of some of the people who have contributed to Firefox&nbsp;2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where's the Firefox&nbsp;2 source code?
          <p>A tarball of the Firefox&nbsp;2 source code is available for <a href=
             "http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0.0.1/source/">download</a>.
             The latest development code can be obtained by <a href=
             "http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla_Source_Code_Via_CVS">cvs</a>.
             Firefox-specific source is in "mozilla/browser", "mozilla/toolkit",
             and "mozilla/chrome". Please follow the <a href=

        </li>
        <li>
          Where is the mail client?
          <p>Firefox&nbsp;2 works with whatever mail client is the default on your system. 
             However, we recommend <a href="/<?=$lang?>/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, our 
             next-generation email client and the perfect complement to Firefox.</p>
