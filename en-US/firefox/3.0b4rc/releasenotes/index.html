      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/system-requirements-v3.html">
         system requirements</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="download">Downloading Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4</h3>
      <p>Mozilla provides Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/all-beta.html">get the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 here</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 <em>will overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Firefox. You won't lose any of your bookmarks or
         browsing history, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might not work
         until updates for them are made available.</p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4</h3>

      <p>You can remove Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Firefox</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>firefox</tt> folder on Linux.</p>
      <p>Removing Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 won't remove your bookmarks, web browsing history,
         extensions or other add-ons. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows 2000, XP</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-osx-uni.png" alt="" /> Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-tux.png" alt="" /> Linux and Unix systems</td>
          <td>~/.mozilla/firefox</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Firefox that you install after removing Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under Firefox 2 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension.  When you install Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 all of your Extensions and Themes will be disabled until Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 determines that either a) they are compatible with the Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;4 release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible.</p>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>
            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e.
          you installed it from a Web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles
          using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the
          browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that
          extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end
          up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install
          the extension globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window
          placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line
          argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create
          Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file.
