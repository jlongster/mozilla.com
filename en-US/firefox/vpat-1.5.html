When software is designed to run on a system that has a keyboard,
product functions shall be executable from a keyboard where the
function itself or the result of performing a function can be discerned
textually.</td>
      <td headers="tph2">Supports
with exceptions through equivalent facilitation:<br />
Keyboard equivalents for all actions are provided. </td>
      <td headers="tph3">Firefox supports all standard
keyboard operation of the user interface. Java and in-page plugins for
content such as Flash cannot be used with the keyboard so they must not
be installed for keyboard-only users. The tab order skips over them
completely, so form controls within them cannot be used without a mouse.<br />
      <br />
Full page plugins such as PDFs can be used if the option "Open with
default application" is used for each full page plugin type under Tools
-&gt; Options -&gt; Downloads -&gt; View and Edit actions. The "Open
with default application" preference is automatically set for screen
reader users.<br />
      <br />
The feature to create a "live bookmark" for websites with Really Simple
Syndication (RSS) is not easily keyboard accessible, however, there is
a workaround for websites that&nbsp;put an "RSS" link on
their page.<br />
      <br />
Workaround Steps:
<ol>
<li>Go to cnn.com or another site with live bookmarks</li>
<li>From the Firefox main menu, Tools -&gt; Page Info -&gt; Links</li>
<li>Tab into the list of links, and arrow down through the list, looking
for a link with the name 'alternate'.</li>
<li>Type Shift+F10 C to copy the link address to the clipboard</li>
<li>From the Firefox main menu, Bookmarks -&gt; Manage bookmarks</li>
<li>From the manage bookmarks main menu, File -&gt; New Live Bookmark</li>
<li>Give the bookmark a name, and then in the feed location field, paste
using Ctrl+V</li>
<li>Hit Enter to accept</li>
</ol>
Special keyboard features in Firefox:
<ol>
<li>Find as you type allows for quick navigation to links and text
searching without opening a separate dialog -- this allows more
convenient use by screen magnification users because there is a single
point of regard for the search. It also assists users of input aids
because there are far fewer keys to type to get the desired location.
For example, it is possible to navigate to the desired link by pressing
2 letter keys rather than tabbing through many links to get there. </li>
<li>Browse with caret allows users to select arbitrary content with the
keyboard and move through content as if inside a read-only editor. This
allows copying arbitrary pieces of text to the clipboard. The F7 key
toggles this feature on/off.</li>
<li>Tabbed browsing helps keyboard users by putting all of the browsed
documents in one Firefox application window rather than cluttering the
Alt+Tab order which makes keyboard navigation within the entire Windows
OS much simpler.</li>
<li>Both history and bookmarks can be searched with a "quick search"
field that quickly narrows the list down via a substring search.</li>
<li>Integrated web search via Ctrl+K is much faster to use than first
going to the search tool's web site. Custom searches can be added to
this quick search bar and the user can switch between them by choosing
from a dropdown available via the standard Alt+down arrow key
combination.</li>
<li>Bookmarks can have a keyword assigned to them which can be typed
into the address bar to bring up the bookmark. A "smart keywords"
feature enhances this even further by allowing custom searches from the
command line such as "word punditry" to look up the word "punditry" in an online
dictionary. These smart keywords can be setup via the context menu for
the search field on the desired website.</li>
<li>The built-in text zoom feature can be accessed with the Ctrl+plus
and Ctrl+minus hotkeys.</li>
<li>The accessibility extension may be installed on top of Firefox,
allowing keyboard access to document structure.</li>

ISimpleDOMText interfaces to expose MathM and SVG, which has no

the SVG information exposed by Firefox).<br />

Documentation for features related that augment accessibility exists in

- A specific help topic for keyboard shortcuts.<br />
- A specific help topic for accessibility options<br />
- Other features that are useful for accessibility are also useful to a
large general audience, so documentation for other features is
organized based on where the feature can be found in Firefox. For
example, viewing with a larger text size is documented under the "Menu
reference", "View", since that is where the feature is located.<br />
- Documentation that is important for using Firefox with a particular
assistive technology is provided by the makers of that assistive
technology, if they support Firefox.<br />
For example, screen reader vendors that support Firefox will be
providing their own documentation on how to use Firefox.<br />
