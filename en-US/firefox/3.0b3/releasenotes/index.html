<div id="main-content">

      <p>Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 is a developer preview release of Mozilla's
         next generation Firefox browser and is being made available for <b>testing
         purposes only</b>.</p>

      <p>These beta releases are targeted to Web developers and our testing community
         to gain feedback before advancing to the next stage in the release process. The
         final version of Firefox 3 will be released when we qualify the product as
         fully ready for our users. Users of the <a
         href="http://www.getfirefox.com">latest released version of Firefox</a> should
         not expect their add-ons to work properly with this beta.</p>

      <p>This beta will give you a taste of what's coming in Firefox 3, but there's 
         still more to come, and much of what you'll see may still be a bit rough around 
         the edges.</p>

      <p>Please see below for an extensive list of <a href="#whatsnew">features and
         enhancements</a> found in Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3, as well as
         <a href="#issues">known issues</a> and <a href="#FAQ">frequently asked
         questions</a>.</p>

      <p>As always, we appreciate your feedback either through this <a

      <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Firefox&nbsp;3</h2>

      <p>Firefox&nbsp;3 is based on the new Gecko 1.9 Web rendering platform, which has
         been under development for the past 30 months and includes nearly 2 million
         lines of code changes, fixing more than 12,000 issues. Gecko 1.9 includes some
         major re-architecting for <a href="#performance">performance</a>, stability,
         correctness, and code simplification and sustainability. Firefox&nbsp;3
         has been built on top of this new platform resulting in a <a
         href="#secure">more secure</a>, <a href="#easy">easier to use</a>, <a
         href="#personal">more personal</a> product with a lot <a href="#engine">under
         the hood</a> to offer website and Firefox add-on developers.</p>
         
      <p><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold;">[Improved in Beta 3!]</span>
         Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 includes approximately 1300 individual changes from
         the previous beta, including fixes for stability, performance, memory usage,
         platform enhancements and user interface improvements. Many of these improvements
         were based on community feedback from the previous beta.</p>

                One-click site info: Click the site favicon in the location bar to
                see who owns the site and to check if your connection is protected
                from eavesdropping. Identity verification is prominently displayed
                and easier to understand. When a site uses Extended Validation (EV)
                SSL certificates, the site favicon button will turn green and show
                the name of the company you're connected to. (<a

                Malware Protection: malware protection warns users when they arrive
                at sites which are known to install viruses, spyware, trojans or other
                malware. (<a href="/firefox/its-an-attack.html">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>New Web Forgery Protection page: the content of pages suspected as
                web forgeries is no longer shown. (<a
                href="/firefox/its-a-trap.html">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>New SSL error pages: clearer and stricter error pages are used when
                Firefox encounters an invalid SSL certificate. (<a 
                href="https://mozilla.com">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>Add-ons and Plugin version check: Firefox now automatically checks
                add-on and plugin versions and will disable older, insecure versions.</li>
            <li>Secure add-on updates: to improve add-on update security, add-ons
                that provide updates in an insecure manner will be disabled.</li>
            <li>Anti-virus integration: Firefox will inform anti-virus software when
                downloading executables.</li>
            <li>Vista Parental Controls: Firefox now respects the Vista system-wide
                parental control setting for disabling file downloads.</li>
            <li>Effective top-level domain (eTLD) service better restricts cookies and 
                other restricted content to a single domain.</li>
            <li>Better protection against <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/re-securing-json/">

            <li>Easier password management: an information bar replaces the old
                password dialog so you can now save passwords after a successful login.</li>
            <li>Simplified add-on installation: the add-ons whitelist has been removed
                making it possible to install extensions from third-party sites in fewer
                clicks.</li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold;">[Improved in Beta 3!]</span>
                New Download Manager: the revised download manager makes it much
                easier to locate downloaded files, and you can see and search on the
				name of the website where a file came from. Your active downloads and 
				time remaining are always shown in the status bar as your files download.</li>
            <li>Resumable downloading: users can now resume downloads after
                restarting the browser or resetting your network connection.</li>
            <li>Full page zoom: from the View menu and via keyboard shortcuts, the
                new zooming feature lets you zoom in and out of entire pages, scaling the
                layout, text and images.</li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold;">[Improved in Beta 3!]</span>
                Podcasts and Videocasts can be associated with your media playback tools.</li>
            <li>Tab scrolling and quickmenu: tabs are easier to locate with the new
                tab scrolling and tab quickmenu.</li>
            <li>Save what you were doing: Firefox will prompt users to save tabs on
                exit.</li>
            <li>Optimized Open in Tabs behavior: opening a folder of bookmarks in
                tabs now appends the new tabs rather than overwriting.</li>
            <li>Location and Search bar size can now be customized with a simple
                resizer item.</li>
            <li>Text selection improvements: multiple text selections can be made
                with Ctrl/Cmd; double-click drag selects in "word-by-word" mode;
                triple-clicking selects a paragraph.</li>
            <li>Find toolbar: the Find toolbar now opens with the current
                selection.</li>
            <li>Plugin management: users can disable individual plugins in the Add-on
                Manager.</li>
            <li>Integration with Vista: Firefox's menus now display using Vista's
                native theme.</li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold;">[Improved in Beta 3!]</span>
                Integration with the Mac: the new Firefox theme makes toolbars, icons, and 
                other user interface elements look like a native OS&nbsp;X application.
                Firefox also uses OS&nbsp;X widgets and spell-checker in web forms and
                supports Growl for notifications of completed downloads and available
                updates.</li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold;">[Improved in Beta 3!]</span>
                Integration with Linux: Firefox's default icons, buttons, and menu
                styles now use the native GTK theme.</li>

                Star button: quickly add bookmarks from the location bar with a
                single click; a second click lets you file and tag them.</li>

                address of a page to see a list of matches from your history and bookmarks;
                a new display makes it easier to scan through the matching results and find
                that page you're looking for. New in Beta 3 is an improved search algorithm
                which calculates the <i>recency</i> and <i>frequency</i> of a visit to come
                up with a <i>frecency</i> score that is used to determine the most relevant
                results.</li>
            <li>Smart Bookmarks Folder: quickly access your recently bookmarked and
                tagged pages, as well as your more frequently visited pages with the new smart

                your frequent searches.</li>
            <li>Web-based protocol handlers: web applications, such as your favorite
                webmail provider, can now be used instead of desktop applications for handling
                mailto: links from other sites. Similar support is available for other
                protocols (Web applications will have to first enable this by registering as
                handlers with Firefox).</li>

                Download &amp; Install Add-ons: the Add-ons Manager (Tools > Add-ons) can
                now be used to download and install a Firefox customization from the thousands
                of Add-ons available from our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">community
                add-ons website</a>. When you first open the Add-ons Manager, a list of
                recommended Add-ons is shown.</li>
            <li>Easy to use Download Actions: a new Applications preferences pane

                to work on optimizing memory use (by releasing cached objects more quickly) and

         maintainer of the extension.</p>
      <p>When you install Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 all of your Extensions and Themes will be 
         disabled until Firefox&nbsp;3&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;3 determines that either a) they are compatible

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>
            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e.
          you installed it from a Web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles
          using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the
          browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that
          extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end
          up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install
          the extension globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window
          placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line
          argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create
          Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file.
