    <h2>Firefox 4 + You = Awesome!</h2>
    <p>We don’t have to tell you how awesome Firefox 4 is. Or how it’s made to make the Web a better 
    place. You know it. You experience it every day. Ever since you downloaded it weeks ago. But not 
    everyone is there yet. Some people just need a little nudge in the right direction. And that’s 
    where you come in.</p>

  <section class="step" id="step2">
    <h2>Know Someone Browsing <br>in the Past?</h2>
    <p>It could be friend, a family member, a colleague, your chiropractor, but chances are you know 
    someone who isn’t on Team Firefox yet. They’re missing out on the awesome. And it just wouldn’t 
    be fair to keep it all for yourself.</p>

  <section class="step" id="step3">
    <h2>Helping is Easy! And Feels Great!</h2>
    <p>All you have to do is share your love of Firefox 4 with someone who needs it and help Team 
    Firefox grow. Here’s how:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li class="check1">Install Firefox 4 on their computer. Get up close and personal and show them the awesome first hand.</li>
      <li class="check2">Take them to school. Send a video that teaches them how to install Firefox 4 on their 
        <a href="#">Mac</a> or 
        <a href="#">PC</a>. 
        Or send them PDF instructions for 
        <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/webhero/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_MAC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1MB)">Mac</a> or 
        <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/webhero/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_PC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1.5MB)">PC</a> instead.</li>
      <li class="check3">Give them the tour. Show off the best Firefox 4 has to offer <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central/">on your computer</a> or send them a <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video/">video</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section class="step" id="step4">
    <h2>Awesome = You!</h2>
    <p>Give yourself a pat on the back. In fact, get someone else to do it for you. You’ve earned it. 
    You not only helped someone get the best of the Web, you helped make sure it stays open, accessible, 
    transparent, safe and &ndash; most of all &ndash; awesome.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your support of our belief in principles over profit and for using a browser that 
    answers to no one but you. Let’s keep building a better Web together.</p>
