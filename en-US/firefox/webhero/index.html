    <h2>Firefox + You = Awesome!</h2>
    <p>We don’t have to tell you how awesome Firefox is. Or how it’s made to make the Web a better 
    place. You know it. You experience it every day. Ever since you downloaded the latest version. 
    But not everyone is there yet. Some people just need a little nudge in the right direction. 
    And that’s where you come in.</p>

    <h2>Know Someone Browsing <br>in the Past?</h2>
    <p>It could be friend, a family member, a colleague, your chiropractor, but chances are you know 
    someone who isn’t on Team Firefox yet. They’re missing out on the awesome. And it just wouldn’t 
    be fair to keep it all for yourself.</p>

    <h2>Helping is Easy! And Feels Great!</h2>
    <p>All you have to do is share your love of Firefox with someone who needs it and help Team 
    Firefox grow. Here’s how:</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li class="check1">Install Firefox on their computer. Get up close and personal and show them the awesome first hand.</li>
      <li class="check2">Take them to school. Send a video that teaches them how to install Firefox on their 
        <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video/?video=upgrade-mac">Mac</a> or 
        <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video/?video=upgrade-win">PC</a>. 
        Or send them PDF instructions for

        <a href="http://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_PC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1.5MB)">PC</a> instead.</li>
      <li class="check3">Give them the tour. Show off the best Firefox has to offer <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central/">on your computer</a> or send them a <a href="/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video/">video</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Awesome = You!</h2>
    <p>Give yourself a pat on the back. In fact, get someone else to do it for you. You’ve earned it. 
    You not only helped someone get the best of the Web, you helped make sure it stays open, accessible, 
    transparent, safe and &ndash; most of all &ndash; awesome.</p>

    <p>Dear <kbd>[enter mom/brother/colleague/dog walker/whoever here]</kbd>,</p>
    <p>It's time we had a little talk about how awesome Mozilla Firefox is: It's pretty awesome. 
    I know you've been missing out, so I'm here to help.</p>
    
    <p>I've had it for a few weeks now and I can tell you that it makes my online experience better 
    every day. Not surprising since it's made to make the Web a better place.</p>
    
    <p>So here are some helpful tips to get Firefox and see all the awesomeness for yourself:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Download this step-by-step guide to installing Firefox (I repeat: easy):<br/>
        <a href="http://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_MAC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1MB)">PDF Install guide for Mac</a><br/>
        <a href="http://static.mozilla.com/moco/en-US/pdf/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_PC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1.5MB)">PDF Install guide for PC</a>
      </li>
      <li>Take the tour and see the best Firefox has to offer: 
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central">http://www.mozilla.org/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central</a>
      </li>
      <li>Or watch a video or two about the latest features:
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video">http://www.mozilla.org/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>OK, now you've got it. So you're not only getting the best the Web has to offer, you're also 
    helping make sure that it stays open, accessible, transparent, safe and — most of all — awesome. 
    Pretty cool, right? That's because Mozilla Firefox values principles over profit and answers to 
    no one but you.</p>
    
    <p>Oh, and if all that seems like too much, I'd be happy to come over and install it for you. 
    We could have a coffee, hang out and catch up. It just wouldn't be fair to keep Firefox all 
    to myself.</p>
    
    <p>Yours in better browsing,</p>
