      <!-- What's New -->

         <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Firefox&nbsp;2</h2>

      <ul class="news spaced">
          <li><p><b>Visual Refresh:</b> Firefox&nbsp;2's theme and user interface have been updated to improve usability without altering 
              the familiarity of the browsing experience.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Built-in phishing protection:</b>
              <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/phishing-protection/">Phishing Protection</a> warns users
              when they encounter suspected Web forgeries, and offers to return the user to their home page. Phishing Protection is turned on by 
              default, and works by checking sites against either a local or online list of known phishing sites. This list is automatically 
              downloaded and regularly updated when the Phishing Protection feature is enabled.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Enhanced search capabilities:</b> Search term suggestions will now appear as users type in the integrated search box when using 
              the Google, Yahoo! or Answers.com search engines. A new search engine manager makes it easier to add, remove and re-order search
              engines, and users will be alerted when Firefox encounters a website that offers new search engines that the user may wish to install.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Improved tabbed browsing:</b> By default, Firefox will open links in new tabs instead of new windows, and each tab will now have
              a <cite>close tab</cite> button. Power users who open more tabs than can fit in a single window will see arrows on the left and right side of
              the tab strip that let them scroll back and forth between their tabs. The History menu will keep a list of recently closed tabs,
              and a shortcut lets users quickly re-open an accidentally closed tab.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Resuming your browsing session:</b> The Session Restore feature restores windows, tabs, text typed in forms, and in-progress downloads
              from the last user session. It will be activated automatically when installing an application update or extension, and users will be asked
              if they want to resume their previous session after a system crash.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Previewing and subscribing to Web feeds:</b> Users can decide how to handle Web feeds (like 
              <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml">this one</a>), either subscribing to them via a Web service or in a 
              standalone RSS reader, or adding them as <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/livebookmarks.html">Live Bookmarks</a>. My Yahoo!, Bloglines 
              and Google Reader come pre-loaded as Web service options, but users can add any Web service that handles RSS feeds.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Inline spell checking:</b> A new built-in spell checker enables users to quickly check the spelling of text entered into Web forms
              (like <a href="http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/ex/simple-form.html">this one</a>) without having to use a separate application.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Live Titles:</b> When a website offers a <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries">microsummary</a> (a regularly updated summary 
              of the most important information on a Web page), users can create a bookmark with a "Live Title". Compact enough to fit in the space 
              available to a bookmark label, they provide more useful information about pages than static page titles, and are regularly updated
              with the latest information. There are <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~myk/microsummaries/sites/">several websites</a> that can be
              bookmarked with Live Titles, and <a href="http://people.mozilla.com/~myk/microsummaries/generators/">even more add-ons</a> to generate
              Live Titles for other popular websites.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Improved Add-ons manager:</b> The new Add-ons manager improves the user interface for managing extensions and themes, combining 
              them both in a single tool.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>JavaScript 1.7:</b> JavaScript 1.7 is a language update introducing 
              <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7">several new features</a> such as generators, iterators, array 
              comprehensions, let expressions, and destructuring assignments. It also includes all the features of JavaScript 1.6.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Extended search plugin format:</b> The Firefox <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_OpenSearch_plugins_for_Firefox">search
              engine format</a> now supports search engine plugins written in Sherlock and OpenSearch formats and allows search engines to provide 
              search term suggestions.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>Updates to the extension system:</b> The extension system has been updated to provide enhanced security and to allow for easier 
              localization of extensions.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Client-side session and persistent storage:</b> New support for storing structured data on the client side, to enable better 
              handling of online transactions and improved performance when dealing with large amounts of data, such as documents and 
              mailboxes. This is based on the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#scs-client-side">WHATWG specification</a> 
              for client-side session and persistent storage.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>SVG text:</b> Support for the svg:textpath specification enables SVG text to follow a curve or shape.</p></li>

          <li><p><b>New Windows installer:</b> Based on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/">Nullsoft Scriptable Install System</a>, the
              new Windows installer resolves many long-standing issues.</p></li>
</ul>

      <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="../system-requirements/">
         system requirements</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="download">Downloading Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>
      <p>Mozilla.org provides Firefox&nbsp;2 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/all.html">get the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;2 here</a>.
         For builds for other systems and languages not provided by Mozilla.org, see
         the Contributed Builds section at the end of this document.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Firefox&nbsp;2 <em>will overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Firefox. You won't lose any of your bookmarks or
         browsing history, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might not work
         until updates for them are made available.</p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Firefox&nbsp;2</h3>

      <p>You can remove Firefox&nbsp;2 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Firefox</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>firefox</tt> folder on Linux.</p>
      <p>Removing Firefox&nbsp;2 won't remove your bookmarks, web browsing history,
         extensions or other add-ons. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows NT</td>
          <td>WINNT\Profiles\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Windows 98, ME</td>
          <td>Windows\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linux and Unix systems</td>
          <td>~/.mozilla/firefox</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Any version of Firefox that you install after removing Firefox&nbsp;2 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

   <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under Firefox 1.5 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Firefox&nbsp;2. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension.  When you install Firefox&nbsp;2 all of your Extensions and Themes will be disabled until Firefox&nbsp;2 determines that either a) they are compatible with the Firefox&nbsp;2 release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible.</p>

      <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>

      <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Firefox&nbsp;2. Please read this before reporting any new bugs.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>All Systems</dt>
      <dd>
      <ul class="spaced">
      <li>Some firewall software may silently block Firefox from running. This often happens
          immediately after Firefox has been installed or updated from a previous version.
          There are <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firewalls">configuration instructions</a>
          available for most popular firewall programs to help you ensure that Firefox is
          allowed to connect to the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>Dictionaries for several locales can't be packaged with the builds, and must be
          manually downloaded by right-clicking in a text area and selecting "Add
          Dictionaries..." from the shortcut menu. New dictionaries are regularly being added
          to Mozilla Add-ons, so if you don't see the particular dictionary you need, check
          back later.
      </li>
      <li>When trying to print web pages with text areas, if the text area contains a misspelled
          word and spell checking is enabled, all the following content of the text area will
          not be printed. You can right-click in the text area and uncheck "Spell check this
          field" to turn off spell checking temporarily while you print.
      </li>
      <li>Access key definitions provided by web pages can now be triggered using Alt+Shift+key
          on Windows, Ctrl+key on Mac OS X, and Ctrl+Shift+key on Unix.
      </li>
      <li>The Session Restore functionality provided in Firefox&nbsp;2 will restore connections
          to services which use session cookies to maintain login state such as GMail. It is
          recommended that users with concerns about the privacy implications of this behavior
          change the value of <tt>browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash</tt> to false.
      </li>
      <li>The option for "Shrink to fit" has been removed in Firefox&nbsp;2. If you wish to change
          this from the value you had set in your previous version of Firefox, change the value
          of <tt>browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>To install Firefox on a multi-user system in a location in which users do not have
          write privileges, Firefox must be run at least once by a privileged user.
          Alternatively, an empty file must be created in the following directory: &lt;install-directory&gt;/extensions/talkback@mozilla.org/chrome.manifest
      </li>
      <li>Software Update will not work if Firefox is installed to a location on your disk
          to which you do not have write access, since Software Update needs to replace or
          create files in this location.
      </li>
      <li>Some financial institutions use port 563 for secure logins, which results in an
          error message. If you encounter this error, make sure that  <tt>network.security.ports.banned.override</tt> includes 563 in the comma-separated list of
          banned network ports to override.

      <ul class="spaced">
      <li>When installing as a restricted-access user on a shared machine into a location
          that you can write to, there may still be negative side effects (default
          browser/other keys not being set correctly). The browser should still function
          however. When installing as a restricted access user do <strong>not</strong>
          attempt to install over an installation in a restricted-access/shared location
          as this may destroy that installation.
      </li>
      <li>Firefox may hang when closing after viewing a PDF file in some older versions
          of the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug in. If you experience this, make sure you are
          using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">newest
          version</a> of the plug in.

      <li>The "Close Other Tabs" action on the shortcut menu of a tab can fail with an error
          when more than 20 tabs are open.
      </li>
      <li>Some users have reported problems viewing Macromedia Flash content on Intel Mac
          computers. To work around this problem, users can remove or move the PowerPC version
          of "Flash Player Enabler.plugin from <tt>/Library/Internet Plug-Ins</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>After installing a new plug-in, Firefox may continue to display information
          for the older version of the plug-in in about:plugins. If this happens, quit
          Firefox, delete the "pluginreg.dat" file from your <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder">profile folder</a>, and relaunch Firefox.
      </li>
      <li>Java does not run on Intel Core processors under Rosetta.

      <li>If Firefox is installed to a location with spaces in the path, it
          may not be able to set itself as default browser and may keep prompting at
          startup. The work around is to install into a path without spaces.
      </li>
      <li>GNOME integration does not work properly with Fedora Core 3.
          Users of Fedora Core 3 will need to download and install
          <a href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/2/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm">linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm</a>.
          After installing the RPM, perform the following command in the directory in which you
          installed Firefox (you will need write permission):
          <p>
            <code>touch .autoreg</code>
          </p>
          The next time you start Firefox, GNOME integration should be functional.

      <li><tt>firefox -remote</tt> (mozilla-xremote-client) no longer works on urls containing
          commas, and is deprecated. <tt>firefox -new-window /url/</tt> will open the url in a

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul class="spaced">

        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible Extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble. 
          
	     Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>

            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e. you installed it from a Web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install the extension globally.</p>
      <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the file.</p>
