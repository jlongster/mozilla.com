	<h2>Phishing Protection</h2>
	<p>Firefox 2 or later contains a built-in Phishing Protection feature
	that warns you of suspected Web forgeries, and offers to take you directly to a search page so you
	can find the real Web site you were looking for.  You can test the Phishing Protection feature by
	browsing to this <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/its-a-trap.html">test site</a>.</p>

	<h4 class="expander-header">What is Phishing?</h4>
	<div class="expander-content">
		<p>Phishing is a form of identity theft
		that occurs when a malicious Web site impersonates a legitimate one in order to acquire sensitive
		information such as passwords, account details, or credit card numbers. Phishing attacks usually
		come from email messages that attempt to lure the recipient into updating their personal
		information on fraudulent, but very real looking, Web sites.  More information on phishing can be
		found at the <a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/">Anti-Phishing Working Group</a>, and there are
		a number of examples and resources available at the <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">Wikipedia Phishing page</a>.</p>

<div class="expander expander-even">
	<h4 class="expander-header">How does the Phishing Protection feature work in Firefox?</h4>
	<div class="expander-content">
		<p>Phishing Protection is turned on by default in Firefox 2 or later,
		and works by checking the sites that you browse to against a list of known
		phishing sites. This list is automatically downloaded and regularly updated
		within Firefox when the Phishing Protection feature is enabled. Since
		phishing attacks can occur very quickly, there's also an option to check
		the sites you browse to against an online service for more up-to-date
		protection. This enhanced capability, and other Phishing Protection
		settings, can be configured in Firefox's Security settings.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="expander expander-odd">
	<h4 class="expander-header">What information is sent to Mozilla or anti-phishing partners when Phishing Protection is enabled?</h4>
	<div class="expander-content">
		<p>When Phishing Protection is used in default mode, no information
		about the sites you visit is sent to Mozilla or anti-phishing partners.
		Rather, sites are checked against a local list that is downloaded to
		your computer and updated on a regular basis. When sites are checked
		against online anti-phishing services such as Google, the address of
		each web site you visit is sent to the online service over a secure SSL
		connection.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="expander expander-even">
	<h4 class="expander-header">How do I use the Phishing Protection feature?</h4>
	<div class="expander-content">
		<p>Phishing Protection options can be found on the Security
		preferences pane.  On Windows and Linux, go to Tools &gt; Options ... &gt; Security. On Mac OS X,
		go to Firefox &gt; Preferences &gt; Options ... &gt; Security.</p>
		<p>You can test to see if Phishing Protection is enabled by browsing to our <a
		href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/its-a-trap.html">test site</a>.  If Phishing Protection is
		turned on, a warning dialog will appear.</p>
		<p>The "Get me out of here!" link will back out of a suspected phishing site and redirect you to
		the Firefox Start page. The "Ignore this warning" link will allow you to continue to the suspected
		phishing site.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="expander expander-odd">
	<h4 class="expander-header">How do I report a suspected phishing site, or what if a warning appears on my own Web site?</h4>
	<div class="expander-content">
		<p>In the Help menu there is an option to "Report Web
		Forgery..." which will bring you to a Web page that you can use to report a suspected phishing
		site, or to submit an incorrect forgery report.</p>
