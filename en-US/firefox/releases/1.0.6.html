      <h2 id="downloadandinstall">Downloading and Installing</h2>

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>
      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="/products/firefox/system-requirements.html">
         system requirements</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="download">Downloading Firefox</h3>
      <p>Mozilla.org provides Firefox for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X in a
         variety of languages. To get the latest version of Firefox, visit 
         <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">GetFirefox.com</a> or browse the 
         <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/">FTP site</a>.
         For builds for other systems and languages not provided by Mozilla.org, see
         the Contributed Builds section at the end of this document.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Firefox</h3>
      <p>Once you have downloaded Firefox, follow these instructions to
         install:</p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>Double click the <code class="filename">Firefox Setup 1.0.6.exe</code> installer to 
         start the install.</p>
      <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
      <p>Once you have downloaded the Firefox 1.0.6.dmg file, double click the Firefox Disk Image to open it in Finder, and then drag the Firefox application onto your hard disk.  Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to appear there.</p>

      <p>For Firefox 1.0, double click the Firefox 1.0.dmg.gz Disk Image to uncompress and mount it. 
         Your browser may have already done this for you. Double click the Firefox 
         Disk Image to open it in Finder and drag the Firefox application onto your 
         hard disk. <strong>Do not double click the icon in the disk image!</strong>
         Be sure to drag the Firefox application out of the disk image and onto your
         Hard Disk before running it. Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to 
         appear there.</p>
      <h3>Linux/GTK2</h3>
      <p>Extract the tarball and run the installer like so:</p>
      <p>
        <code>
          tar -xzvf firefox-1.0.6.installer.tar.gz<br />
          cd firefox-installer<br />
          ./firefox-installer
        </code></p>
      <p>If you have Nautilus set up to run Executable Text Files you can just 
         double click firefox-installer to run.</p>
      <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
      <p>Extract the compressed archive and run <code>firefox</code></p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Uninstalling Firefox</h3>
      <p>To uninstall Firefox, follow these instructions:</p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>From the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, choose <kbd>Control Panel</kbd>. When the 
         Control Panel appears, double click <kbd>Add/Remove Programs</kbd>. Find 
         "Mozilla Firefox (1.0.6)" in the list and click <kbd>Remove</kbd> to uninstall.</p>
      <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
      <p>Drag the <code class="filename">Firefox</code> application to the Trash.</p>
      <h3>Others</h3>
      <p>Remove the <code class="filename">firefox</code> folder.</p>
      <p>These instructions leave your profile in place in case you install Firefox 
         again in the future. If you wish to remove your profile folder, remove 
         the location described below in the <strong>"Profile Folder"</strong> section. 
         Note that by doing this you are destroying all of your Bookmarks, saved passwords,
         settings and other information and should you decide to use Firefox again you
         will be starting with a clean profile.</p>
         
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Other Information</h2>
      <h3 id="profilefolder">Profile Folder</h3>
      <p>Firefox stores your user data in one of the following locations:</p>
      <table style="font-size: smaller;" >
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows 2000, XP</td>
          <td>Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows NT</td>
          <td>WINNT\Profiles\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows 98, ME</td>
          <td>Windows\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/img/ico-osx.png" alt="" /> Mac OS X</td>
          <td>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/img/ico-tux.png" alt="" /> Linux and Unix systems</td>
          <td>~/.mozilla/firefox</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>If you were using Firefox 0.8 as your default browser prior to upgrading to 
         Firefox 1.0 or later version, data from your profile will be copied into the new location. You 
         can remove the old "Phoenix" folder at your leisure.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>
      <p>When you upgrade to a new version of Firefox all of your Extensions and Themes
         will be disabled until Firefox determines that either a) they are compatible
         with the new release or b) there are newer versions available that are 
         compatible. This is because Firefox changes from release to release and as such
         the ways in which some extensions integrate changes, meaning there can be problems
         when running an older extension with a newer version of Firefox. If you find
         that your favorite Extension or Theme has not been updated to be compatible with
         this release of Firefox, write the author and encourage them to update it.</p>
      <p>This automatic updating of Extensions and Themes does not apply to users of
         Firefox 0.8 or below who upgrade to Firefox 1.0 or a later version. Those Extensions will be 
         disabled when 1.0.6 starts, and users will have to download and install 1.0.6 
         compatible versions manually.    
      </p>
      <p>To prevent the kind of problems we had with the 0.8 release (users were having 
         the browser not start with "No XBL Binding for Browser" errors, and finding 
         that their theme was broken), all of your extensions will be disabled when you
         move to 1.0 or later version. If you were using 0.9 or 1.0PR, when you first run 1.0.6, Firefox will
         try and connect to update.mozilla.org to look for newer, compatible versions
         of your Extensions, and if they are available it will download and install them.
         If you were using 0.8, you will have to find newer compatible versions yourself.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="otherchanges">Other Changes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On Linux, Firefox now follows GTK's setting for textbox keybindings, so pressing 
          Ctrl+letters triggers application shortcuts instead of readline-like text-editing 
          shortcuts. For details, see <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Emacs_Keybindings_%28Firefox%29">this document</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>
      <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Firefox 1.0.6. Please read this
         before reporting any new bugs, and watch it regularly (we'll update it as new 
         bugs are found in the release).</p>
        
      <h3>All Systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prior to installing Firefox 1.0.6, please ensure that the directory you've 
          chosen to install into is clean and doesn't contain any previous Firefox 
          installations.
       </li>
        <li>
          If you install Firefox on a multi-user system in an area in which there is
          restricted access privileges, you must run Firefox as a user with access to
          that location upon installation so that all initial startup files are generated.
          If this is not done, when a user without write access to the install location
          attempts to start Firefox, they will not have sufficient privileges to allow
          Firefox to generate the initial startup files it needs to.
        </li>
        <li>
          When upgrading, all your Extensions and Themes will be disabled. This is not
          an issue, but it may appear to be one (hence its listing here). For rationale,
          see "Extension and Themes" above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Software Update does not request proxy authentication and will fail if you
          are behind a proxy server. (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259429">bug</a>)
          The workaround is to visit a web page in the browser and log in to the proxy
          server and then perform Software Update. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Software Update will not work if Firefox is installed to a location that you
          do not have write access to, since Software Update needs to replace or create
          files in this location.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Help documentation refers to "Single Window Mode" options
          regarding "Force links opened in new windows to open in [New Tab, Same Tab]."
          This function was disabled at the last minute due to problems we were experiencing
          with it, so ignore this section of Help. To re-enable the Single Window Mode
          options (at your own risk - there may be crashes), use the Configuration Console
          (accessed by entering "about:config" in the Location bar and pressing Enter)
          to set <code>browser.tabs.showSingleWindowModePrefs</code> to <strong>true</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On Windows 2000 systems, some users may experience a crash on exit of the browser 
          after viewing a page that calls the Windows Media Player 9 plug-in.  If you experience
          this, make sure you are using the <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">
          newest version of the Java plug-in</a>, greater than Java 1.5.  Older versions of the
          Java plug-in may conflict with Windows Media Player 9 in Firefox. 
        </li>
        <li>
          When installing as a restricted access user on a shared machine into a location
          that you can write to, there may still be negative side effects (default 
          browser/other keys not being set correctly). The browser should still function 
          however. When installing as a restricted access user do <strong>not</strong>
          attempt to install over an installation in a restricted-access/shared location 
          as this may destroy that installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Firefox may hang when closing after viewing a PDF file in some older versions 
          of the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug in. If you experience this, make sure you are
          using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">newest 
          version</a> of the plug in.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Windows 98 and Windows ME systems, the Application icon may appear as a 
          Windows icon.
        </li>
      </ul>
          
      <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Do NOT run Firefox from the Disk Image!</strong> - doing this will
          cause an infinite restart loop (the symptom of which is a Firefox icon that
          bounces briefly in the Dock then disappears and reappears, bounces and 
          disappears, over and over). To break Firefox out of this loop, open a 
          Terminal and type "killall firefox-bin" and press enter. Install Firefox to
          a location you have write access to and try again. When installing on a multi-
          user limited access system, install it into a shared location as administrator,
          run it once and then all users should be able to access it. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If Firefox does not display a browser window</strong>, quit Firefox 
          using Cmd+Q and open <code>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;garble&gt;.default/</code>
          and remove <code>localstore.rdf</code>. Restart Firefox. Any toolbar 
          customizations you have made or window placement will be lost
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Linux and Unix systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If Firefox is installed to a location with spaces in the path, Firefox
          may not be able to set itself as Default browser and may keep prompting at
          startup. The work around is to install into a path without spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          GNOME integration does not work properly with Fedora Core 3. 
          Users of Fedora Core 3 will need to download and install
          <a href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/2/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm">linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm</a>.
          After installing the RPM, perform the following command in the directory you 
          installed Firefox into (you will need write permission):
          <p>
            <code>touch .autoreg</code>
          </p>
          <p>The next time you start Firefox, GNOME integration should be functional.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Web Page Rendering</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Firefox is powered by the same Gecko layout engine as other Mozilla software. 
          If you encounter a problem with a website that does not correctly display
          then it is usually a problem with Gecko, not Firefox itself. Such problems
          should be reported in the Core product (not the Firefox product) in 
          <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>. If you are technically 
          minded, try and create a reduced test case and this will help get your bug
          more attention.
        </li>    
      </ul>
      
      <p>For additional issues, FAQs, Tips and Tricks plus general Firefox help be sure 
         to check out <a href="../../../support/firefox/">Firefox 
         Help</a> and the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">Firefox 
         forums</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/">MozillaZine</a>.</p>
         
      <p>The Configuration Console (accessed by entering "about:config" in the Location
         bar and pressing Enter) gives advanced/experienced users direct control over
         Firefox's preferences. This system is for use by people who know what they are
         doing only, by changing a value incorrectly you may damage or destroy your
         Firefox installation! Look to Help sites for handy preferences to tweak to 
         customize Firefox further.</p>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible Extensions can cause problems with your browser,
          including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. 
          If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer
          working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance,
          degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble. 
          Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac OS X, run:
          <p><code>
            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>
          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme
          is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start
          normally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e. 
         you installed it from a web page) and then wish to install it for all user 
         profiles using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must 
         restart the browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of 
         traces of that extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do
         this you may end up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be
         unable to install the extension globally.</p>
      <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window 
         placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try 
         creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing 
         bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line 
         argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create 
         Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over 
         one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find 
         a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the 
         file.</p>

             and "mozilla/chrome". Please follow the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/build.html">build instructions</a>.</p>

          Where is the mail client?
          <p>Firefox works with whatever mail client is the default on your system. 
             However, we recommend <a href="../../thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, our 
             next generation email client and the perfect complement to Firefox.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I spell Firefox? How do I abbreviate it?
          <p>Firefox is spelled F-i-r-e-f-o-x - only the first letter capitalized
             (i.e. not FireFox, not Foxfire, FoxFire or whatever else a number of
             folk seem to think it to be called.) The preferred abbreviation is
             "Fx" or "fx".</p></li>
