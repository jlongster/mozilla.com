	<h2>Firefox Release Notes</h2>
          <p>Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 is a beta of our next major release of our award-winning Firefox Web browser.
             <a href="../index.html">More information</a> about Firefox 
             is available.</p>
</div>


      <p>Extensions installed under Firefox 1.0 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Firefox 1.5 Beta. Please report any issues to the maintainer of the extension. When you install Firefox 1.5 Beta all of your Extensions and Themes may be disabled until Firefox 1.5 Beta determines that either a) they are compatible with the Firefox 1.5 Beta release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible. This is because Firefox changes from release to release and as such the ways in which some extensions integrate changes, meaning there can be problems when running an older extension with a newer version of Firefox. If you find that your favorite Extension or Theme has not been updated to be compatible with this release of Firefox, write the author and encourage them to update it.
      </p>        

      <h3>All Systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you install Firefox 1.5 Beta on a multi-user system in an area in which there is restricted access privileges, you must run Firefox 1.5 Beta as a user with access to that location upon installation so that all initial startup files are generated.
          If this is not done, when a user without write access to the install location attempts to start Firefox 1.5 Beta, they will not have sufficient privileges to allow Firefox 1.5 Beta to generate the initial startup files it needs to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Software Update will not work if Firefox 1.5 Beta is installed to a location that you do not have write access to, since Software Update needs to replace or create files in this location.
        </li>

      </ul>
      
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When installing as a restricted access user on a shared machine into a location
          that you can write to, there may still be negative side effects (default 
          browser/other keys not being set correctly). The browser should still function 
          however. When installing as a restricted access user do <strong>not</strong>
          attempt to install over an installation in a restricted-access/shared location 
          as this may destroy that installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Firefox 1.5 Beta may hang when closing after viewing a PDF file in some older versions 
          of the Adobe Acrobat Reader plug in. If you experience this make sure you are
          using the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">newest 
          version</a> of the plug in.
        </li>
      </ul>
          
      <h3>Linux and Unix systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If Firefox 1.5 Beta is installed to a location with spaces in the path, it
          may not be able to set itself as Default browser and may keep prompting at
          startup. The work around is to install into a path without spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          GNOME integration does not work properly with Fedora Core 3. 
          Users of Fedora Core 3 will need to download and install
          <a href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/2/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm">linc-1.0.3-3.1.i386.rpm</a>.
          After installing the RPM, perform the following command in the directory you 
          installed Firefox 1.5 Beta into (you will need write permission):
          <p>
            <code>touch .autoreg</code>
          </p>
          <p>The next time you start Firefox 1.5 Beta, GNOME integration should be functional.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Web Page Rendering</h3>
             <p>The Configuration Console (accessed by entering "about:config" in the Location bar and pressing Enter) gives advanced/experienced users direct control over Firefox's preferences. This system is for use by people who know what they are doing only, by changing a value incorrectly you may damage or destroy your
         Firefox installation! Look to Help sites for handy preferences to tweak to customize Firefox further.</p>

      <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible Extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble. 
          
	     Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac OS X, run:
          <p><code>
            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>
          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e. you installed it from a web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install the extension globally.</p>
      <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the file.</p>

        <li>
          I use another browser because...
          <p>If you're not using Firefox, tell the development team why. We read the 
             feedback at the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">Firefox 
             forums</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Why haven't you responded to the mail I sent you?
          <p>Use the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">forums</a>. The 
             Firefox team reads them regularly. We all get a lot of email and your email may 
             get lost.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where can I get themes and add-ons (extensions)?
          <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/?application=firefox">Extensions</a> and
             <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/themes/?application=firefox">themes</a> can be downloaded from
             <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/?application=firefox">Mozilla Update</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Who is working on Firefox?
          <p>Lots of people. See Help-&gt;About Mozilla Firefox, Credits for a list of some of the people
             who have contributed to Firefox.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where's the Firefox source code?
          <p>A tarball of the 1.5 Beta 2 source code is available for
             <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5b2/source/firefox-1.5b2-source.tar.bz2">download</a>. The latest development
             code can be obtained by <a href="../../../cvs.html">cvs</a>.
             Firefox-specific source is in "mozilla/browser", "mozilla/toolkit",
             and "mozilla/chrome". Please follow the <a
             href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/build.html">build instructions</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where is the mail client?
          <p>Firefox works with whatever mail client is the default on your system. 
             However, we recommend <a href="../../thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, our 
             next generation email client and the perfect complement to Firefox.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I spell Firefox? How do I abbreviate it?
          <p>Firefox is spelled F-i-r-e-f-o-x - only the first letter capitalized
             (i.e. not FireFox, not Foxfire, FoxFire or whatever else a number of
             folk seem to think it to be called.) The preferred abbreviation is
             "Fx" or "fx".</p></li>
