    <!-- What's New -->
    <h2 id="new">What's New</h2>
    <p>Here's what's new in this release of Firefox:</p>
    <ul class="news">
      <li>New Default Theme
          <p>An updated Default Theme now presents a uniform appearance across
             all three platforms - a new crisp, clear look for Windows users.
             Finetuning for GNOME will follow in future releases.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Comprehensive Data Migration
          <p>Switching to Firefox has never been easier now that Firefox imports
             data like Favorites, History, Settings, Cookies and Passwords from
             Internet Explorer. Firefox can also import from Mozilla 1.x,
             Netscape 4.x, 6.x and 7.x, and Opera. Mac OS X and Linux migrators
             for browsers like Safari, OmniWeb, Konqueror etc. will arrive in
             future releases.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Extension/Theme Manager
          <p>New Extension and Theme Managers provide a convenient way to manage
             and update your add-ons. SmartUpdate also
             notifies you of updates to Firefox. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Smaller Download
          <p>Windows users will find Firefox is now only 4.7MB to download.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Help
          <p>A new online help system is available.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Lots of bug fixes and improvements
          <p>Copy Image, the ability to delete individual items from Autocomplete
             lists, SMB/SFTP support on GNOME via gnome-vfs, better Bookmarks,
             Search and many other refinements fine tune the browsing experience.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Linux/GTK2 Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Installer
          <p>Firefox now comes with an installer for Linux/GTK2 users. The new
             installer makes the installation process much simpler.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Look and Feel Updates
          <p>Ongoing improvements have been made to improve the way Firefox
             adheres to your GTK2 themes, such as menus.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Talkback for GTK2
          <p>Help us nail down crashes by submitting talkback reports with
             this crash reporting tool.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="install">Installing Firefox</h2>
    <p>Once you have downloaded a Firefox installer or compressed archive, follow
      these instructions to install:</p>

    <p>First, for these preview releases it is <strong>strongly recommended
       that you uninstall any previous version of Firefox first</strong>.
       Installing over the top of an older version may cause unpredictable problems.
       If you install over the top of an older version and want to file bugs,
       please do a clean install into a fresh directory before doing so.</p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>Double click the <code class="filename">FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe</code> installer to start the install.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - Do not install Firefox over the top of another Firefox
       installation. If you want to install Firefox 0.9 into the same folder that you
       had Firefox 0.8 in, uninstall Firefox 0.8 first. Upgrading will be fixed in
       a future release.</p>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
    <p>Double click the Firefox Compressed Disk Image to mount. Your browser may
      have already uncompressed the image and mounted it for you. Double click the
      Firefox 0.9 Disk Image and drag the Firefox application onto your hard disk.
      Drag the icon to your Dock if you want it to appear there.</p>

    <h3>Linux/GTK2</h3>
    <p>Extract the tarball and run the installer like so:</p>
    <p>
       <code>tar -xzvf firefox-0.9-i686-linux-gtk2+xft.tar.gz<br />
             cd firefox-0.9-i686-linux-gtk2+xft/<br />
             ./firefox-installer</code></p>

    <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
    <p>Extract the compressed archive and run <code>firefox</code></p>

    <h2>Uninstalling Firefox</h2>
    <p>To uninstall Firefox, follow these instructions:</p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>From the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, choose <kbd>Control Panel</kbd>. When the
      Control Panel appears, double click <kbd>Add or Remove Programs</kbd>. Find
      "Mozilla Firefox (0.9.)" in the list and click <kbd>Remove</kbd> to uninstall.</p>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
    <p>Drag the <code class="filename">Firefox</code> application to the Trash.</p>

    <h3>Others</h3>
    <p>Remove the <code class="filename">firefox</code> folder.</p>

    <p>These instructions leave your profile in place in case you install Firefox
      again in the future. If you wish to remove your Firefox
      <a href="http://texturizer.net/firefox/edit.html#profile">profile folder</a>,
      follow these instructions:</p>

    <h3>Windows</h3>
    <p>Locate your Application Data folder, this is usually under
      <code class="filename">Documents and Settings\<var>&lt;username&gt;</var>\Application Data</code>.
      You may need to make hidden files visible in Windows Explorer, since the
      Application Data folder is hidden. If your username is "Joe", and your
      Documents and Settings folder is on C:\, your profile folder is here:
      <code class="filename">C:\Documents and Settings\Joe\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</code>. Delete
      the Firefox folder to remove your profile data.</p>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
    <p>Open the <code class="filename">Library</code> folder in your Home folder, and remove the
      <code class="filename">Firefox</code> folder. (<code class="filename">~/Library/Firefox/</code>).</p>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>Remove <code class="filename">~/.firefox</code>.</p>

    <h2>Changes You Should Be Aware Of</h2>
    <h3>Profile Folder</h3>
    <p>Firefox 0.9 now stores your user data in one of the following locations:</p>
    
      <table style="font-size: smaller;" >
        <tr><td><img src="/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows</td><td>(XP, 2K and NT) Documents and Settings\&lt;UserName&gt;\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox<br />('98 and ME) \Windows\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox</td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="/img/ico-osx.png" alt="" /> Mac OS X</td><td>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox</td></tr>
        <tr><td><img src="/img/ico-tux.png" alt="" /> Linux</td><td>~/.mozilla/firefox/</td></tr>
      </table>
    
    <p>If you were using Firefox 0.8 as your default browser prior to upgrading to
       Firefox 0.9, data from your profile will be copied into the new location. You
       can remove the old "Phoenix" folder at your leisure.</p>
    <h3>Note to Nightly Build Users</h3>
    <p>Part way between 0.8 and 0.9, the profile location changed from: Application Data\Firefox (Windows),
       ~/Library/Firefox (Mac OS X) and ~/.firefox (Linux) to the locations above. When you run 0.9 for
       the first time, information about your profiles will be copied to the new location but the
       data will not be moved. You must not delete the Application Data\Firefox, ~/Library/Firefox or
       ~/.firefox folder, since these still hold your profile, and the profiles.ini file at the new location
       refers back to them. You must move the files yourself manually and hand-edit profiles.ini to
       update the registry to point to the new location. Users of Firefox 0.8 should not have to worry
       about this, this is only for community testers and people who have been living on the
       bleeding edge.</p>

    <h3>Old Extensions and Themes</h3>
    <p>To prevent the kind of problems we had with the 0.8 release (users were
       having the browser not start with "No XBL Binding for Browser" errors, and
       finding that their theme was broken), when you run 0.9 for the first time
       all of your extensions will be automatically disabled, and the theme
       will be reset to the default. You must then look for newer versions of your
       extensions that are compatible with Firefox 0.9 since the extension
       API has changed. After Firefox 0.9 these updates should be more seamless.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>
    <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Firefox 0.9. Please
      read this before reporting any new bugs, and watch it regularly (we'll update
      it as new bugs are found in the release).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If Firefox 0.9 is placed in a location with limited access privileges, it
          should be run by a user with access to that location <em>first</em>, so
          that all initial startup files are generated. There may be issues still where
          if a restricted-access user is the first to run the app, these files may not
          be generated properly and Firefox may enter an infinite restart loop. This will
          be fixed in a future release.</li>
      <li><strong>If Firefox will not display a browser window on Mac OS X</strong>, quit
          Firefox using Cmd+Q and open
          <code>~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/default.abc/</code> and remove
          <code>localstore.rdf</code>. Restart Firefox. Any toolbar customizations you have
          made or window placement will be lost</li>
      <li>We have made some changes to fix security problems involving one site
          targeting links and form submissions into a frameset created by another
          site, however these changes may cause problems with some sites.
          If you encounter problems where sites are trying to use this capability
          legitimately and you need them to work, you can use <code>about:config</code>
          and set <code>docshell.frameloadcheck.disabled</code> to <code><strong>true</strong></code>
          to disable the security check. Please file bugs on the URLs that are problematic,
          if you encounter any.</li>
      <li>Firefox utilizes large chunks of Mozilla Application Suite code. Many
          of the problems you may experience in Firefox are actually
          problems in this Mozilla core code. If you find a problem with page
          content or connectivity then it is probably a Mozilla problem and
          should be reported to the Browser product in Bugzilla, not to the
          Firefox product.</li>
      <li>Menus and folders on the bookmark toolbar do not always collapse
          correctly for Firefox users on Windows.</li>
      <li>"Use this theme" checkbox in theme install doesn't function properly
          and you may have to switch themes by selecting
          <span class="mnu">Tools > Themes</span>, selecting the Theme you want
          to use and clicking "Use Theme". Also, some themes will not completely
          switch without a restart.</li>
      <li>Users of nightly builds between 0.8 and 0.9, including the Release
          Candidate are advised to <strong>delete the extensions folder</strong>
          in their profile folder if the application enters an infinite restart
          loop on startup.</li>
      <li>
        <script>
        <!--
          function installDLMgrPatch()
          {
            if (InstallTrigger.updateEnabled())
              InstallTrigger.install({"Downloads Performance Patch" : "dlperfpatch.xpi"});
            else
              alert("Software installation is disabled.");
          }
        //-->
        </script>
        Some users have experienced performance problems with the Downloads window - if the
        Downloads window experiences slow painting, try <a href="#" onclick="installDLMgrPatch();">installing this patch</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The Extension Update and Software Update systems have not yet been
          well tested. You may experience problems. These will be addressed in
          the 1.0 beta release. As of the time of release, the update service
          has not been deployed on update.mozilla.org which means updates will
          not be available. You may see status notifications for available
          updates when there are none.

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>It should <strong>not</strong> be necessary to create a new profile when you upgrade from
      a previous version of Firefox providing you do <strong>disable all extensions</strong>
      from the prior version before upgrading. To do this, open the old version and open
      <span class="mnu">Tools &gt; Options</span> and click the <strong>Extensions</strong>
      panel. Click on each of the extensions listed and choose <strong>Disable Extension</strong>.
      Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the Options window. Now it is safe to install Firefox.</p>
    <p>Once you have installed Firefox, check to see if there are new versions of all of your
      extensions that are compatible with the new version, and install them. In the future this
      process may be automated.</p>
    <p>If you enable an extension from an older version of Firebird or Phoenix and it causes
      problems, run the older version of the browser and disable the extension, then run the
      newer version again.</p>
    <p>If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window placement,
      toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try creating a new profile
      and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing bugs. Create a new profile by running
      Firefox with the -P command line argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then
      choose "Create Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc)
      over one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do find a
      particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach the file.</p>

      <li>
        I use another browser because...
        <p>If you're not using Firefox, tell the development team why. We read
          the feedback at the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">Firefox
          forums</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Why haven't you responded to the mail I sent you?
        <p>Use the <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/index.php?c=4">forums</a>. The
          Firefox team reads them regularly. We all get a lot of email and your email may
          get lost.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Where can I get themes and add-ons (extensions)?
        <p><a href="http://update.mozilla.org/">Extensions</a> and
          <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/">themes</a> can be downloaded
          from <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Update</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who is working on Firefox?
        <p>Currently Ben Goodger (working for the Mozilla Foundation), Brian Ryner (for IBM),
          Pierre Chanial, Blake Ross, Dave Hyatt, Benjamin Smedberg, Darin Fisher and the
          wider community contributing to the Mozilla codebase. Asa Dotzler, Leaf Nunes and
          a team of QA contacts handle bug triage, releases, and other odds and ends. For
          full details, see the credits
          in <span class="mnu">Help &gt; About</span>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Where's the Firefox source code?
        <p>cvs.mozilla.org. Mozilla trunk + mozilla/browser + mozilla/toolkit.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Is Firefox just Mozilla with a couple UI tweaks?
        <p>Firefox is substantially different, featuring a number of exclusive features
          and countless refinements. Well over 120,000 lines of code have been added or
          changed in the browser and toolkit CVS directories since the project began.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What happened with the name <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Phoenix</span> Firebird?
        <p>It had to change because of trademark issues. The new name is Firefox. See
          the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/firefox-name-faq.html">Renaming FAQ</a> for
          more information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Where is the mail client?
        <p>Firefox works with whatever mail client is the default on your system. However, we recommend
          <a href="../../thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, our next generation
          email client and the perfect complement to Firefox.</p>
