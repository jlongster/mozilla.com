	<h3 class="top">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

	<div id="free" class="expander expander-odd first-expander">
		<h3 class="expander-header">Is Firefox really free?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>Yes! Firefox is 100% free of charge.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

    <div id="safe" class="expander">
		<h3 class="expander-header">Is Firefox safe to download?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>Very safe. And, once you download Firefox you’ll be
			<a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/security/">better protected</a> from
			online bad guys. (Be sure to download Firefox from the official
			Mozilla.com website.)</p>
		</div>
    </div>
	
    <div id="compatible" class="expander expander-odd">
		<h3 class="expander-header">Will my favorite sites and my webmail work with Firefox?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>Absolutely. The sites you visit are independent of the browser
			you choose to use. For example, you don't need to use AOL to access
			your AOL email and you don't need Internet Explorer to use
			Microsoft’s Hotmail.</p>
			<p>You may have installed plug-ins (like
			<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/kb/Using+the+Flash+plugin+with+Firefox">Flash</a>)
			in the past to view some sites (like YouTube) with your current browser.
			You’ll need to reinstall those on Firefox, but they’re free and only
			take a few seconds to download.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="easy" class="expander">
		<h3 class="expander-header">Is it difficult to use Firefox? Will I have to spend time learning how to use it?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>No. In fact, we pride ourselves on making Firefox as easy to use
			as possible. Getting started is quite intuitive, but if you want to
			learn more we have some online <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/tips/">tips</a>
			and <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/video/">videos</a> to help you make
			the most of your new browser. Our support site also has
			<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/kb/Browsing+basics">a more complete set of instructions</a>
			if you’d like more detail.</p>
			<p>When you switch from Internet Explorer, you may notice a few
			differences in the terminology&mdash;<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/kb/For+Internet+Explorer+Users">we’ve documented them</a>
			to clear up any confusion.</p>
		</div>
    </div>
	
    <div id="favorites" class="expander expander-odd">
		<h3 class="expander-header">Will my favorites and other browser settings be transferred?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>Yes. To make the switch as seamless as possible, you can import
			your favorites (bookmarks), history, saved passwords and other
			settings during the installation process. Or, if you decide to take
			care of that later we have
			<a href="http://support.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/kb/Importing+Bookmarks+And+Other+Data+From+Internet+Explorer">detailed instructions</a>
			to walk you through the simple steps.</p>
		</div>

    <div id="secure" class="expander">
		<h3 class="expander-header">What makes Firefox safer?</h3>

			including anti-phishing and anti-malware protection, instant Web site ID,
			automated updates and more.</p>
			<p>Also, our <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/security/">open-source security process</a>
			means we have thousands of experts around the world checking our
			code for weak spots. We’re constantly monitoring threats to your
			online safety and regularly release new Firefox updates with the
			latest patches and protection. An <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/security/">independent study</a>
			has verified that Firefox users are at risk for significantly less
			time during the year than Internet Explorer users.</p>
		</div>
    </div>
	
    <div id="unsure" class="expander">
		<h3 class="expander-header">What if I’m not sure about switching?</h3>
		<div class="expander-content">
			<p>We’ve made that part as easy as possible, too. You can install
			Firefox and try it without changing anything else in your computer
			setup. If you change your mind, you can still go back to your old
			browser at any time.</p>
