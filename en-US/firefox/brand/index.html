        <div class="">
            <p>Here is your guide to all things Firefox, the flagship brand in the Mozilla universe. It's full of guidelines, examples and tips to help you create websites and communications that are on brand and on style, both online and off.</p>
            <p>The Firefox brand is a living thing. It grows, changes and adapts. So we want you to have easy access to the latest and greatest out there. And lo we created this toolkit. And it was good.</p>

                <p>What this guide attempts to do is to define what makes Firefox special and give us some tools to help us articulate, express and evaluate the brand in our daily work.</p>
                <p>This foundation (brand promise, position and voice) is a great beginning, a tool that allows us to speak with one voice. </p>

                    <p>This is not an ad. This is not a tagline. This is our promise to our users. It's that simple. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <p>We're quite content to be the odd browser out.</p>
                <p>We don't have a fancy stock abbreviation to go alongside our name in the press. We don't have a profit margin. We don't have sacred rock stars that we put above others. We don't make the same deals, sign the same contracts or shake the same hands as everyone else.</p>
                <p>And all of this is fine by us.</p>
                <p>We're a pack of independently spirited, fiercely unconventional people who do things a little differently. Where others may value the bottom line, we value—well—values. When a competitor considers making something proprietary,we strive to set it free.</p>
                <p>And while most products and technologies are developed behind closed doors, ours are cultivated out in the open for everyone to see. We're not beholden to stake, share or power holders—we answer to no one but you. And we don't operate this way for the fun of it, even though it is incredibly fun. We operate this way because we believe it's the right thing to do.</p>
                <p>We believe in principle over profit.</p>
                <p>We believe that secrecy is trumped by honesty.</p>
                <p>And corporate interest by community.</p>
                <p>We believe that the web is more cared for than owned.</p>
                <p>More of a resource to be tended to than a mere commodity to be sold.</p>
                <p>And we strongly believe in innovation that puts users front, center, and squarely in the driver's seat.</p>
                <p>But most importantly, we believe in you.</p>
                <p>We believe that the world's best browser is made possible by engineers, programmers, designers and people just like you who give their time, talents, energy and support to the cause. And we believe that together, with this cause in mind, we can continue to innovate for the benefit of the individual and the betterment of the web, so that it always and forever serves the greater good.</p>
                <p>We are a ll Mozilla Firefox. And we're not just a different kind of browser.</p>
                <p>We're a browser that is making a difference.</p>

                    <p>The fur is now a deeper orange and has much more detail (like in the snout, for example).</p>
                    <p>The tail now wraps around the globe, hugging it and showing more volume in 3D space. Note the globe peeks through in some places.</p>

            <h1>CHANNEL LOGOS</h1>
            <p>Firefox is broken down into a series of sub-brands — or “channels” — from the tried, tested and true mainstream release down to the experimental, here-there-be-monsters Nightly builds. Each one has its own visual identity and here’s everything you need to know about that.</p>
            
            <h2>Firefox</h2>
            Channel - Final Release
            Audience - Mainstream Web users (100,000,000s)
            Tone - Friendly, accessible, trusted
            Visual Direction - Crisp, clean, light blue as primary Web color
            
            Firefox Beta
            Channel - Beta
            Audience - Non-technical early adopters (10,000,000s)
            Tone - Friendly, accessible, mix of cutting edge and stable
            Visual Direction - Crisp, clean, light blue as primary Web color*
            
            *In contexts where two Firefox logos can be displayed next to each other (ex. mobile desktops), the version with the Beta sash should be used for added clarity.
            
            Firefox Aurora
            Channel - Aurora
            Audience - Technical early adopters (1,000,000s)
            Tone - Exciting, edgier, more attitude
            Visual Direction - Branding works best on dark backgrounds, purple as primary Web color
            
            Firefox Nightly
            Channel - Nightly
            Audience - Mainstream Web users (100,000s)
            Tone - Developer-focused, not too inviting
            Visual Direction - Branding works best on dark backgrounds, dark blue as primary Web color

            <h1>Wordmarks</h1>
            <p>Firefox is more than a cute fox wrapped around a globe. Sometimes we use words alone to represent our various channels and brands. Here’s how we do that and what you need to know to get a gold star when using our wordmarks.</p>
            
            <h2>Firefox</h2>
            <p>Our standard Firefox wordmark is set in Meta Medium and comes in two flavours: without the Mozilla wordmark as standard and with Mozilla as optional for external use.</p>
            
            <h2>Standard wordmark</h2>
            <p>Wordmark ouside of product when Mozilla universal website tab not present</p>
            
            <h2>Firefox Beta</h2>
            <p>The Beta wordmark uses our tiered font system of Meta Medium for the product and Meta normal for the sub-brand.</p>
            
            <h2>Firefox Aurora</h2>
            <p>Aurora uses our tiered font system and a special standard of white on dark.</p>
            
            <h2>Firefox</h2>
            <p>Nightly uses the same wordmark system as Aurora.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contents" id="typefaces">
            <script>// <![CDATA[
            document.getElementById('typefaces').id = 'page-typefaces';
            // ]]></script>
            <h1>Typefaces</h1>
            <p>If you’re the kind of person who’s passionate about x-heights, kerning and descenders — you know, a font nerd — you’re in good company here. Even if you’re not, here’s a list of the fonts we use at Mozilla, including their use cases and some other tasty tidbits.</p>
            
            <h2>Meta Bold</h2>
            <p>The old, trusted Mozilla standard, Meta Bold is reserved for our Mozilla wordmark and usage at the Foundation level. It’s our rock.</p>
            
            <h2>Meta Medium</h2>
            <p>At the product level, Meta Medium is our champion and creates a second tier of Meta font usage. Sleek, svelte, nimble.</p>
            
            <h2>Meta Normal</h2>
            <p>Our third tier of font usage features Meta Normal as the light and lean choice for sub-branding. Light in weight, heavy in awesome.</p>
            
            <h2>Meta Black</h2>
            <p>Reserved for our Web headlines, Meta Black goes above and beyond its font family siblings and throws its weight around to get noticed.</p>
            
            <h2>Georgia</h2>
            <p>A classic typeface, Georgia is another standard font used in various settings and functions for both Web and print.</p>
            
            <h2>Recommended Open Fonts</h2>
            <p>When it comes to typography at Mozilla, we love supporting the Open Font community. We’ve selected a few we go to regularly to share with you here.</p>
            
            <ul>

            <h1>Illustrations</h1>
            <p>Occasionally we use illustrations to help humanize the brand on our websites and designs. Plus, we think they look purdy. Here, then, is everything you need to know about Mozilla and pictures.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Characters</h2>
            <p>This group of fun, loveable monsters brings extra personality to the brand beyond our logo while bringing a little smile to your face. We tend to use them sparingly, but when applied correctly, they liven up text and generally bring some fun to a page. </p>
            <p>If you’d like to use one for something you’re doing, or even request a custom character, get in touch using the button below.</p>
            
            <h2>Feature Tabs</h2>
            <p>We use these iconic versions of our various standard product features to draw focus to and break up text. They even do this cool float thing when you mouse over them. Go ahead, give a try. Neat, huh?</p>
            <p>OK, that’s enough.</p>

            // ]]></script>
            <h1>GEAR</h1>
            <p>Shirts, hats, bags, stickers, mouse pads — we just love putting our logo on stuff around here. So whether you call it “swag” or “merch” or “workwear,” here’s the skinny on Mozilla-branded merchandise, from S to XL.</p>
            
            <h2>Wear the Love</h2>
            <p>Gear is a pretty big deal at Mozilla. Whatever you do in the community, chances are you have at least — at least! — one Firefox shirt. We make gear to mark milestones, celebrate our people or sometimes just because it’s been a while since we had something new.</p>
            <p>If you’d like some fresh gear for a party or other event, use the request button below. We’ll always be more than happy to help you out. But if you’re planning on making some of your own, we’ve made a handy dandy guide you can follow. Check it out, won’t you?</p>

            <h1>Style Assets</h1>
            <p>We’ve got style for miles and miles. Or at least as many pixels as this page is long. Here’s everything you need to make pretty websites, Mozilla-style.</p>
            
            <h2>Universal Tab</h2>
            <p>Your own Mozilla tour guide, the universal tab should be present on all of our Web properties. It acts as a dropdown quick index of sites throughout our community so you can always find what you’re looking for, no matter what page you’re on.</p>
            
            <h2>Button Styles</h2>
            <p>Pressing our buttons should be as satisfying as popping bubble wrap — and way more useful. We use green as our standard for anything downloadable and Firefox-related. Other colors in our standard style are for interactive states and all other calls-to-action.</p>
            
            <h2>Backgrounds</h2>
            <p>Classic in look, backgrounds on Mozilla Web properties consist of subtle top gradients layered with vertical sketched lines. This ain’t your grandma’s wallpaper — unless your grandma is really stylish.</p>

            <h1>Domain Strategy</h1>
            <p>If you're interested in creating new Web content or functionality, please follow this guide to determine the right home for it in the Mozilla Web universe.</p>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The mozilla.org domain is used for almost all Mozilla sites. New sites use sub-domains (example.mozilla.org) and new pages on existing sites use sub-directories ( HYPERLINK "http://www.mozilla.org/example" www.mozilla.org/example).</p>
            <p>The key for deciding which to use is whether you're creating new functionality or making use of existing functionality.</p>
            <p>For example, if you have a new campaign that lets people submit videos of themselves talking about the new Firefox breath-freshening feature, that would be a standalone site (fresh.mozilla.org). The purpose of the site will determine the full URL (addons.mozilla.org serves add-ons, support.mozilla.org provides support, etc.).</p>
            <p>If you just wanted a static page about the new breath-freshening feature, that would be added to the existing Firefox product site ( HYPERLINK "http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/fresh" www.mozilla.org/firefox/fresh). In this case, the www in the full URL signals that the site is for static Web pages, which fits the need for the new page.</p>
            <p>In some instances it makes sense not to use the mozilla.org domain, although no other Mozilla organizational domains should be used on public sites (mozilla.com, mozillafoundation.org, mozilla.net, etc.). There may still be legacy sites using these, but we are in the process of phasing those out.</p>
            <p>The full Domain Name Strategy document has more information about these exceptions as well as more details about the use of the mozilla.org domain.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about any of this, please feel free to reach out to David Boswell.</p>

            <h1>A Note on Tone</h1>
            <p>If you’ve been reading this toolkit, you probably already have a pretty good sense of our written voice. But if you want a better idea of how to sound when writing for Mozilla, keep reading.</p>
            
            <h2>Mozilla is people. (It's people!)</h2>
            <p>Mozillians live all over the world. We have different roles. We do different jobs (often several at once). But one thing we have in common is that we're a group of human beings building products and technologies for other human beings.</p>
            <p>Whenever a user — or anyone else, for that matter — reads a piece of Mozilla communication, they should feel like there's a person on the other end who recognizes that they are the same. They should feel like we care about them and how they spend their time online. That's not a gimmick or a piece of marketing, either. It's one of the principles Mozilla was founded on.</p>
            <p>So what does that mean, practically speaking? It means that, yes, sometimes we'll use colloquial or conversational language. We'll use contractions and speak to people in a familiar way (sorry, couldn't think of another word that started with a C). We'll use humor to make people feel good. Or be serious when the situation warrants.</p>
            <p>We should not, however, talk down to people or use overly technical language. It's OK to be clever, but not just for its own sake (or because we're too in love with our own words). We should avoid snark and cynicism. And we should never make people feel like we're smarter or better than they are. We should speak on their level, while being friendly and inclusive.</p>
            <p>The point is, we never want our users to forget that there are real live people behind our products and our words. And when writing, we can't forget that, either. As our <a>Firefox Brand Platform</a> states, we should be unconventional, engaging, honest, smart and confident. If you remember that, you should be in good shape.</p>
            <p>If you're a real stickler for detail, read all about our <a>copy rules</a>. Or find out how this affects translated copy in our <a>localization section</a>.</p>

            <h2>Local in Every Locale</h2>
            <p>If you do localization work for Mozilla, first of all, thank you. Second of all, thank you. We’re incredibly lucky to have community members who undertake this important and difficult task.</p>
            <p>Localization isn’t an extra step in our communication process; it is the process. We’re all part of the same team. And although our copy is generally written in English first, that doesn’t mean that localized versions should be perceived any differently. We only have one audience at Mozilla — users — and regardless of their language, location or any other factors, they should all have the same experience with Firefox.</p>
            <p>To that end, here are some tips to help you along:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Make it your own. <span>Localized content shouldn’t be a literal translation, but it should capture the same meaning and sentiment. So feel free to pull it apart and put it back together; replace an English expression with one from your native language; Mozilla-fy it for your region.</span></li>
                <li>When in doubt, ask. <span>If something isn't clear — or even if it is but you just want to be extra sure — speak up. You can find us on irc in the #marketing channel or send us an email at  HYPERLINK "mailto:l10n@mozilla.org" l10n@mozilla.org. It can only help make the process better if we know what kinds of problems you’re running into, which leads nicely into:</span></li>
                <li>Help us help you. <span>Pardon the cliche, but this is an important one. We can work to fix the problems we know about, but we can't do a thing about those we don't even know exist. So tell us what recurring issues you've experienced, what works and what doesn't — it could be a language thing, a cultural issue or something to do with tone (especially when dealing with languages that have both formal and informal forms). Whatever it is, please pass it on.</span></li>
