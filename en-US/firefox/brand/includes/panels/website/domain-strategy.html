                    <p>The mozilla.org domain is used for almost all Mozilla sites. New sites use sub-domains (example.mozilla.org) and new pages on existing sites use sub-directories (www.mozilla.org/example).</p>
                    <p>The key for deciding which to use is whether you're creating new functionality or making use of existing functionality.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you have a new campaign that lets people submit videos of themselves talking about the new Firefox breath-freshening feature, that would be a standalone site (fresh.mozilla.org). The purpose of the site will determine the full URL (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">addons.mozilla.org</a> serves add-ons, <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/">support.mozilla.org</a> provides support, etc.).</p>
                    <p>If you just wanted a static page about the new breath-freshening feature, that would be added to the existing Firefox product site (www.mozilla.org/firefox/fresh). In this case, the www in the full URL signals that the site is for static Web pages, which fits the need for the new page.</p>
                    <p>In some instances it makes sense not to use the mozilla.org domain, although no other Mozilla organizational domains should be used on public sites (mozilla.com, mozillafoundation.org, mozilla.net, etc.). There may still be legacy sites using these, but we are in the process of phasing those out.</p>
                    <p>The full Domain Name Strategy document has more information about these exceptions as well as more details about the use of the mozilla.org domain.</p>
