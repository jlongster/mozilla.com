                    <p>Our logo is our identity. It signals who and what Firefox is. It sets us apart and it is the single most important piece of visual communication we have. And we’re quite fond of it. (Just look at how cute it is. Don’t you just want to scratch behind its widdle ears? Ahem.)</p>
                    <p>Here you’ll find everything you need to know about using our logo in a variety of cases, including what to avoid.</p>

                    <p>This is our version of the Pirate Code. Except we don’t sail ships. Or pillage. Or plunder. OK, so it’s not like that at all. But if you’re going to use our logo, please follow these rules.</p>

                        Our standard lockup. Use this in most cases when the <a href="#style-assets">Mozilla universal website tab</a> — or other clear mention of Mozilla — isn’t present.</li>

                        The standard lockup without Mozilla. Use this when in proximity to a Mozilla wordmark to avoid redundancy. This horizontal lockup also works with the channel logos.</li>
                    <li class="three"><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/covehead/firefox/brand-toolkit/identity-guidelines-logo.png" width="220" height="158" alt="Firefox Logo" />
                        The logo on its own. You can safely use this in most cases, though avoid using the logo alone when dealing with the channel logos.</li>
                    <li class="four"><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/covehead/firefox/brand-toolkit/identity-guidelines-logo-wordmark.png" width="220" height="200" alt="Firefox Logo" />
                        Alternate lockup. Use this on posters, banners or when horizontal space is an issue. Unlike the standard horizontal lockup, do not use this with any of the channel logos or wordmarks.</li>

                    <p>To avoid a faux-pas — or "faux-paw," as the case may be — please note the differences in tail and globe detail between past logos and our most recent version.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p class="one">The new globe feels more like a sphere than a flat disc and has stronger highlights. Oh, and there’s been a bit of continental drift, too.</p>
                    <p class="two">The fur is now a deeper orange and has much more detail (like in the snout, for example).</p>
                    <p class="three">The tail now wraps around the globe, hugging it and showing more volume in 3D space. Note the globe peeks through in some places.</p>
