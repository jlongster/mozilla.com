                <p>Shirts, hats, bags, stickers, mouse pads — we just love putting our logo on stuff around here. So whether you call it “swag” or “merch” or “workwear,” here’s the skinny on Mozilla-branded merchandise, from S to XL.</p>

                   <h2>Wear the Love</h2>
                   <p>Gear is a pretty big deal at Mozilla. Whatever you do in the community, chances are you have at least — at least! — one Firefox shirt. We make gear to mark milestones, celebrate our people or sometimes just because it’s been a while since we had something new.</p>
                   <p>If you’d like some fresh gear for a party or other event, use the request button below. We’ll always be more than happy to help you out.</p>
