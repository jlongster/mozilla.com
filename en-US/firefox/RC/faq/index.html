<dt>What is Panorama?</dt>
<dd><p>Panorama is the next evolution of tabbed browsing. With a single keystroke, it gives you an overview of all your open tabs, so you can organize them into groups and switch between them with ease. For example, you might create separate groups for tabs related to vacation, work, recipes, games and social networking – whatever makes sense to you. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r0TQJ-gGi0">Take a closer look at Panorama.</a></p></dd>

<dt>Why does Firefox look different than it used to?</dt>
<dd><p> 
    We updated the default look of Firefox to compliment the way
    people use the Web today. The new look makes it easier to focus on
    Web content and to control your Firefox tools.  For more
    details, <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/tabcandy/">this
    blog post</a> explains what we did to streamline the interface and
    why Tabs are on Top by default in Firefox 4.
</dd></p>

<dt>Can I still customize the user interface?</dt>
<dd><p>
    Of course! The Firefox user-interface (UI) remains completely
    customizable. You can switch the locations of tabs and whether or not
    a menu bar, bookmark bar or status bar is visible.
</p></dd>

<dt>How else can I customize Firefox?</dt>
<dd><p>
    Firefox is the most customizable browser on the planet with a growing
    library of hundreds of thousands of free Firefox Add-ons and themes to
    choose from to add features and functionality to your Web experience.

<dd><p>
    Firefox 4 RC is feature and UI complete, but there may be some
    changes as we work to polish the final product.
</p></dd>

<dt>How did stability improve in Firefox 4 Beta?</dt>
<dd><p>
    Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash in
    the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight plugins. If
    one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or freezes, it will not
    affect the rest of the page or Firefox. You can simply reload the page
    to restart the plugin and try again.
</p></dd>

<dt>How does Firefox 4 RC improve performance?</dt>
<dd><p>
    Firefox 4 RC includes the enhanced high-performance SpiderMonkey
    JavaScript engine with TraceMonkey and JägerMonkey JITs. You'll notice
    the speed in everything from faster start-up time and improved
    page-load speed to the performance of Web applications.  Firefox 4 RC
    also has hardware acceleration, which enables websites to load and
    respond to rich and interactive content like Web games, apps or photos
    faster. Hardware acceleration is on by default on all supported
    hardware.
</dd></p>



<dt>How did privacy and security improve in Firefox 4?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    Mozilla Firefox puts your privacy first. Firefox 4 RC builds on
    existing ways to protect your privacy in Firefox, including
    browser privacy controls and private browsing mode. Firefox 4 RC
    adds the following privacy and security improvements to Firefox:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Do Not Track</strong> The Do Not Track feature in Firefox tells websites that
    you would like to opt-out of tracking used for behavioral
    advertising. Firefox is leading the Web towards a universal standard
    with this feature. Users will not notice any difference in their
    browsing experience until sites and advertisers start to respond to
    the header.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong> The Content Security Policy in
    Firefox is designed to shut down cross-site scripting attacks by
    providing a mechanism for sites to explicitly tell the browser
    which content is legitimate. The browser can then disregard any
    content which has not been blessed by the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)</strong> Websites can now help keep
    your sensitive data safe from interception during the log-in
    process by telling Firefox to automatically establish secure
    connections to their servers.
  </p>
</dd></p>

<dt>How did stability improve in the Firefox 4 RC?</dt>
<dd><p>
    Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash in
    the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight
    plugins. If one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or freezes,
    it will not affect the rest of Firefox. Instead, you can simply
    reload the page to restart the plugin and try again.
