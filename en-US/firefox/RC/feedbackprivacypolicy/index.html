<p>We’re working hard to protect your privacy while delivering products and services that bring you the performance and protection you desire in your personal computing. This Mozilla Feedback Add-on Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Mozilla Corporation (“Mozilla”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation, collects and uses information from user tests and feedback forms in Mozilla’s Feedback Add-on included in some Firefox beta versions (“Feedback Add-on”). The Feedback Add-on includes Mozilla’s <a href="https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com">Test Pilot</a> and comment forms to provide positive and negative feedback about your experience with the Firefox beta. The information collected by Test Pilot is referred to as “Test Data” and the comments and other information submitted via the feedback forms are referred to as “Feedback Data.” This Policy does not apply to Mozilla websites, or other products or services, each of which has its own privacy policy. To see what information is collected by Firefox other than through the Feedback Add-on, see Mozilla’s <a href="/<?=$lang?>/legal/privacy/firefox.html">Firefox Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>What is Test Pilot?</h3>

<p>Test Pilot was created to provide a new set of tools and capabilities to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our user testing. It has been incorporated as an add-on into the Firefox beta version you have chosen to download. Any data collected by Test Pilot will only be stored on your computer unless you choose to submit it to Mozilla. You also have the choice of opting out of any data collection by Test Pilot. You are in control. Please visit <a href="https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com">https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com</a> for more information on Test Pilot.</p>

<h3>Information Collected from Test Pilot Participants</h3>

<p>In order to improve our user testing, Mozilla will collect certain data in relation to your participation in Test Pilot tests. Your data won't be transmitted until you elect to submit your data.  When your data is submitted, it will be aggregated into a big batch with everyone else's info and will not be directly connected back to you. All the aggregated data will be open to the public, but to be extra clear none of it will be personally identifiable as yours or anyone else's.</p>

<p>You will have an opportunity to review a description of each test, including its duration and the types of data that will be collected through the test (the “Test Description”). The data required for the test (“Test Data”) will be collected locally on your computer in a database within Firefox. At the end of the test, you will be able to review the Test Data and will be asked whether you would like to submit the Test Data to Mozilla.</p>

<p>The Test Data consist of information that cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity, and include your self-assessed technical level, computer configuration, the version of Firefox or other products that you use, the URL or Uniform Resource Locators (the addresses of web pages you navigate). The Test Data do not include your name or email address, and will not be combined with any information that personally identifies you.</p>

<p>If you change your mind about participating in a test, you may opt out from the test at any time before you choose to share the Test Data, and the Test Data will not be transmitted to Mozilla. Similarly, if you choose not to submit the Test Data at the end of the test, the Test Data will not be transmitted to Mozilla.</p>

<h3>What are the <img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/firefox/beta/4/feedback-happy.png" alt="Happy Face" /> and <img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/firefox/beta/4/feedback-sad.png" alt="Sad Face" /> Feedback Features?</h3>

<p>When you click on the happy face or sad face button in the Feedback Add-on, a form will open up with a box for you to provide either positive or negative comments about your experiences using the Firefox beta.</p>

<h3>Information Collected from the Feedback Forms</h3>

<p>Feedback Data is collected via web forms hosted on Mozilla servers. There is one form for positive feedback, another for negative feedback. You will have the option on the negative feedback form of providing the URL you were visiting when you had a bad experience with the Firefox beta. Mozilla utilizes a filter to remove personal information from the URL, but as a precaution you should be sure to delete any personally identifiable elements included in the URL string before submitting your feedback. This feature also sends your IP address and a variety of Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including but not limited to the version of Firefox you are using and your language preference. Except for your IP address, Mozilla makes this information together with your comments public on a website dashboard, so don’t include any personal information or inappropriate content in your comments. Except for build ID, which is needed to send you the feedback form, this feature does not send information to Mozilla until you click to submit your comments. If you do not wish your comments and Non-Personal Information to be made public, don’t use this feature to submit your comments.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Data to the U.S.</h3>

<p>By using the Feedback Add-on, you consent to the transfer of the Test Data and Feedback Data and any other information collected under this Policy to the United States, which may provide a lesser level of data security than in your country of residence.</p>

<h3>Information Disclosure</h3>

<p>Other than its wholly-owned subsidiaries listed below, Mozilla does not share the raw Test Data with any third party. We only provide the raw Test Data to Mozilla employees and contractors, as well as employees and contractors of the following wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies of Mozilla: MZ Denmark ApS, MZ Canada Ltd, MOZ 2008 Corporation, Mozilla Online Ltd, and Mozilla Japan. Mozilla requires its employees and contractors to sign confidentiality agreements that prohibit them from using the raw data other than for internal Mozilla purposes, or from disclosing these data to third parties.</p>

<p>Mozilla uses a third party, Widgix LLC (dba as SurveyGizmo) for its tests. See the <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/the-fine-print/">SurveyGizmo Privacy Policy</a>. SurveyGizmo states that they will not share this information with others or use the information for purposes other than to maintain the services they provide to Mozilla.</p>

<p>All Test Data will be made anonymous and aggregated, and made available to the general public in the form of aggregate data. These aggregate data do not personally identify any test participants.</p>

<p>Test Pilot is designed to remove the Test Data from the local database in your Firefox browser (1) when you choose to opt out of Test Pilot or the test; (2) 7 days after you choose to submit Test Data to Mozilla, or (3) when you choose not to submit the Test Data when requested at the end of the test. Some users have told us they want to keep their Test Data after submitting it to us. This is why we will not delete it from your browser for 7 days after you submit. For those who wish to keep their Test Data, please ensure you save it during this 7-day window.</p>

<p>As noted above, The Feedback Data, and in the case of negative feedback, the URL you entered into the form, if any, are made public. Your IP address is not made public.</p>

<h3>Data Retention</h3>

<p>We will retain Test Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes of improving our user testing, unless a longer retention period is required by law and/or regulations.</p>

<h3>Policy Changes</h3>

<p>Mozilla may change this Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on this page. When Mozilla changes this Policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on a Firefox beta webpage. Substantive changes may also be announced through the standard mechanisms by which Mozilla communicates with its users and community, including Mozilla's "announce" mailing list and newsgroup. It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand the terms of this Policy. You should periodically check this page for any changes to the current policy.</p>

<p>Data collected will be governed by the Policy in effect at the time the data was submitted to Mozilla.</p>

<h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>

<p>You may request appropriate access, correction, or deletion of Data, as permitted by law. We will seek to comply with such requests, provided that we have sufficient information to identify the Data related to you. Since the Feedback Add-on collects very limited information about participants, it may not be possible to identify Data that you submitted. We recommend that you print a copy of the Data for your records before you submit it to Mozilla.</p>
