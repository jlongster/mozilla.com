	<p>Whether it&#8217;s news from CNN and the BBC, or posts on your friend&#8217;s blog, the Web is updated continually. Firefox&#8217;s Live Bookmarks feature automatically keeps track of these updates for you, so you always know when new content has been added to your favorite sites.</p>

	<p>With Live Bookmarks, the content comes to you. Instead of constantly checking Web pages for changes and additions, a Live Bookmark delivers updates to you as soon as they are available.</p>

	<h3>Check it out</h3>

	<p>Click Latest Headlines in your Firefox Bookmarks toolbar to scan the latest news headlines from BBC News. Find a headline that looks interesting, and select it to jump to the story.</p>
