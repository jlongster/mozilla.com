      <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New in Firefox&nbsp;3</h2>

      <p>Firefox&nbsp;3 is based on the Gecko 1.9 Web rendering platform, 
         which has been under development for the past 33 months. Building on the previous
         release, Gecko 1.9 has more than 14,000 updates including some major re-architecting 
         to provide improved <a href="#performance">performance</a>, stability, rendering
         correctness, and code simplification and sustainability. Firefox&nbsp;3
         has been built on top of this new platform resulting in a <a
         href="#secure">more secure</a>, <a href="#easy">easier to use</a>, <a
         href="#personal">more personal</a> product with a lot more <a href="#engine">under
         the hood</a> to offer website and Firefox add-on developers.</p>

            <li>One-click site info: Click the site favicon in the location bar to
                see who owns the site and to check if your connection is protected
                from eavesdropping. Identity verification is prominently displayed
                and easier to understand. When a site uses Extended Validation (EV)
                SSL certificates, the site favicon button will turn green and show
                the name of the company you're connected to. (<a 
                href="https://www.paypal.com">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>Malware Protection: malware protection warns users when they arrive
                at sites which are known to install viruses, spyware, trojans or other
                malware. (<a href="/firefox/its-an-attack.html">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>New Web Forgery Protection page: the content of pages suspected as
                web forgeries is no longer shown. (<a
                href="/firefox/its-a-trap.html">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>New SSL error pages: clearer and stricter error pages are used when
                Firefox encounters an invalid SSL certificate. (<a 
                href="https://mozilla.com">Try it here!</a>)</li>
            <li>Add-ons and Plugin version check: Firefox now automatically checks
                add-on and plugin versions and will disable older, insecure versions.</li>
            <li>Secure add-on updates: to improve add-on update security, add-ons
                that provide updates in an insecure manner will be disabled.</li>
            <li>Anti-virus integration: Firefox will inform anti-virus software when
                downloading executables.</li>
            <li>Vista Parental Controls: Firefox now respects the Vista system-wide
                parental control setting for disabling file downloads.</li>
            <li>Effective top-level domain (eTLD) service better restricts cookies and 
                other restricted content to a single domain.</li>
            <li>Better protection against <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/re-securing-json/">
                cross-site JSON data leaks</a>.</li>

            <li>Easier password management: an information bar replaces the old
                password dialog so you can now save passwords after a successful login.</li>
            <li>Simplified add-on installation: the add-ons whitelist has been removed
                making it possible to install extensions from third-party sites in fewer
                clicks.</li>
            <li>New Download Manager: the revised download manager makes it much
                easier to locate downloaded files, and you can see and search on the
                name of the website where a file came from. Your active downloads and 
                time remaining are always shown in the status bar as your files download.</li>
            <li>Resumable downloading: users can now resume downloads after
                restarting the browser or resetting your network connection.</li>
            <li>Full page zoom: from the View menu and via keyboard shortcuts, the
                new zooming feature lets you zoom in and out of entire pages, scaling the
                layout, text and images, or optionally only the text size. Your settings
                will be remembered whenever you return to the site.</li>
            <li>Podcasts and Videocasts can be associated with your media playback tools.</li>
            <li>Tab scrolling and quickmenu: tabs are easier to locate with the new
                tab scrolling and tab quickmenu.</li>
            <li>Save what you were doing: Firefox will prompt users to save tabs on
                exit.</li>
            <li>Optimized Open in Tabs behavior: opening a folder of bookmarks in
                tabs now appends the new tabs rather than overwriting.</li>
            <li>Location and Search bar size can now be customized with a simple
                resizer item.</li>
            <li>Text selection improvements: multiple text selections can be made
                with Ctrl/Cmd; double-click drag selects in "word-by-word" mode;
                triple-clicking selects a paragraph.</li>
            <li>Find toolbar: the Find toolbar now opens with the current
                selection.</li>
            <li>Plugin management: users can disable individual plugins in the Add-on
                Manager.</li>
            <li>Integration with Windows: Firefox now has improved Windows icons, and uses
                native user interface widgets in the browser and in web forms.</li>
            <li>Integration with the Mac: the new Firefox theme makes toolbars, icons, and 
                other user interface elements look like a native OS&nbsp;X application.
                Firefox also uses OS&nbsp;X widgets and supports Growl for notifications 
                of completed downloads and available updates. A combined back and forward 
                control make it even easier to move between web pages.</li>
            <li>Integration with Linux: Firefox's default icons, buttons, and menu
                styles now use the native GTK theme.</li>

                single click; a second click lets you file and tag them.</li>
            <li>Tags: associate keywords with your bookmarks to sort them by
                topic.</li>
            <li>Location bar &amp; auto-complete: type in all or part of the title, tag or 
                address of a page to see a list of matches from your history and bookmarks;
                a new display makes it easier to scan through the matching results and find
                that page you're looking for. Results are returned according to their 
                <i>frecency</i> (a combination of <i>frequency</i> and <i>recency</i> of
                visits to that page) ensuring that you're seeing the most relevant matches.
                An adaptive learning algorithm further tunes the results to your patterns!</li>
            <li>Smart Bookmarks Folder: quickly access your recently bookmarked and
                tagged pages, as well as your more frequently visited pages with the new smart
                bookmarks folder on your bookmark toolbar.</li>
            <li>Places Organizer: view, organize and search through all of your bookmarks,
                tags, and browsing history with multiple views and smart folders to store 
                your frequent searches. Create and restore full backups whenever you want.</li>
            <li>Web-based protocol handlers: web applications, such as your favorite
                webmail provider, can now be used instead of desktop applications for handling
                mailto: links from other sites. Similar support is available for other
                protocols (Web applications will have to first enable this by registering as
                handlers with Firefox).</li>
            <li>Download &amp; Install Add-ons: the Add-ons Manager (Tools > Add-ons) can
                now be used to download and install a Firefox customization from the thousands
                of Add-ons available from our <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">community
                add-ons website</a>. When you first open the Add-ons Manager, a list of
                recommended Add-ons is shown.</li>
            <li>Easy to use Download Actions: a new Applications preferences pane
                provides a better UI for configuring handlers for various file types and
                protocol schemes.</li>

                architectures in Gecko 1.9 provides rendering improvements in CSS, SVG as well
                as improved display of fonts with ligatures and complex scripts.</li>
            <li>Color management: (set gfx.color_management.enabled on in
                about:config and restart the browser to enable.) Firefox can now adjust images
                with embedded color profiles.</li>
            <li>Offline support: enables web applications to provide offline
                functionality (website authors must add support for offline browsing to their
                site for this feature to be available to users).</li>

                optimizations have resulted in continued improvements in performance.
                Compared to Firefox 2, web applications like Google Mail and Zoho Office
                run twice as fast in Firefox&nbsp;3, and the popular 
                SunSpider test from Apple shows improvements over previous releases.</li>
            <li>Memory usage: Several new technologies work together to reduce the amount
                of memory used by Firefox&nbsp;3 over a web browsing session. 
                Memory cycles are broken and collected by an automated cycle collector, a new 
                memory allocator reduces fragmentation, hundreds of leaks have been fixed, and 
                caching strategies have been tuned.</li>
            <li>Reliability: A user's bookmarks, history, cookies, and preferences
                are now stored in a transactionally secure database format which will prevent

      <h3 id="requirements">System Requirements</h3>

      <p>Before installing, make sure your computer meets the <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/system-requirements-v3.html">
         system requirements</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="download">Downloading Firefox&nbsp;3</h3>
      <p>Mozilla provides Firefox&nbsp;3 for Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X in a
         variety of languages. You can <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/all-rc.html">get the latest version 
         of Firefox&nbsp;3 here</a>. For builds for other systems and languages not 
         provided by Mozilla.org, see the Contributed Builds section at the end of this document.</p>

      <h3 id="install">Installing Firefox&nbsp;3</h3>
      <p>Please note that installing Firefox&nbsp;3 <em>will overwrite</em> your
         existing installation of Firefox on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X and Linux. On Windows,  
         Firefox&nbsp;3 installs in a new folder. For all systems, you won't lose 
         any of your bookmarks or browsing history, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might 
         not work until updates for them are made available.</p>

      <h3 id="uninstall">Removing Firefox&nbsp;3</h3>

      <p>You can remove Firefox&nbsp;3 through the <tt>Control Panel</tt> in the
         <tt>Start Menu</tt> on Windows, by removing the <tt>Firefox</tt> application on 
         OS X, or by removing the <tt>firefox</tt> folder on Linux.</p>
      <p>Removing Firefox&nbsp;3 won't remove your bookmarks, web browsing history,
         extensions or other add-ons. This data is stored in your <em>profile
         folder</em>, which is located in one of the following locations depending on
         your operating system:</p>

      <table style="font-size: small;" border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows Vista</td>
          <td>Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="<?=$config['static_prefix']?>/img/ico-win.png" alt="" /> Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003</td>

      </table>
      <p>Any version of Firefox that you install after removing Firefox&nbsp;3 will
         continue to use the data from this profile folder.</p>

      <h3 id="extensions">Extensions and Themes</h3>

      <p>Extensions installed under previous versions of Firefox may be incompatible and/or require 
         updates to work with Firefox&nbsp;3. Please report any issues to the 
         maintainer of the extension.</p>
      <p>When you install Firefox&nbsp;3 all of your Extensions and Themes will be 
         disabled until Firefox&nbsp;3 determines that either a) they are compatible 
         with the Firefox&nbsp;3 release or b) there are newer versions available that 
         are compatible.</p>

      <ul class="spaced">
        <li>
          Poorly designed or incompatible extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash, slow down page display, etc. If you encounter strange problems relating to parts of the browser no longer working, the browser not starting, windows with strange or distorted appearance, degraded performance, etc, you may be suffering from Extension or Theme trouble.
          Restart the browser in Safe Mode. On Windows, start using the "Safe Mode" shortcut created in your
          Start menu or by running <code>firefox.exe -safe-mode</code>. On Linux, 
          start with <code>./firefox -safe-mode</code> and on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, run:
          <p><code>
            cd /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/<br />
            ./firefox-bin -safe-mode
          </code></p>

          When started in Safe Mode all extensions are disabled and the Default theme is used. Disable the Extension/Theme that is causing trouble and then start normally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you uninstall an extension that is installed with your user profile (i.e.
          you installed it from a Web page) and then wish to install it for all user profiles
          using the -install-global-extension command line flag, you must restart the
          browser once to cleanse the profile extensions datasource of traces of that
          extension before installing with the switch. If you do not do this you may end
          up with a jammed entry in the Extensions list and will be unable to install
          the extension globally.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads, window
          placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is recommended that you try
          creating a new profile and attempting to reproduce the problem before filing
          bugs. Create a new profile by running Firefox with the -P command line
          argument, choose the "Manage Profiles" button and then choose "Create
          Profile...". Migrate your settings files (Bookmarks, Saved Passwords, etc) over
          one by one, checking each time to see if the problems resurface. If you do
          find a particular profile data file is causing a problem, file a bug and attach
          the file.

        </li>
        <li>
          Where's the Firefox&nbsp;3 source code?
          <p>A tarball of the Firefox&nbsp;3 source code is available for <a href=
             "http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/3.0rc1/source/">download</a>.
             The latest development code can be obtained by <a href=
