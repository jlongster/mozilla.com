<p>OK, not really, but Attack Sites (also known as malware or <a href="http://www.stopbadware.org/home/help">badware</a>) can attack your computer without you even realizing it. These attacks can steal your personal information, damage your computer or use your system to attack others. Sometimes a site you trust can be turned into an Attack Site without the owner's knowledge. Firefox 3 or later provides built-in <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/phishing-protection/">Phishing and Malware Protection</a> to help you avoid Attack Sites. If you are using Firefox 3 or later, you should have been warned away from this page.</p>

<h5>You can help make yourself safer from Attack Sites by:</h5>

<ul>
<li><strong>not downloading software from sites you don't trust</strong> even if they claim it is required; if a site says that a plugin is necessary, go directly to the plugin vendor's web site instead;</li>
<li><strong>keeping your system up to date</strong> by applying security updates promptly for Firefox and other applications, as well as your computer's operating system;</li>
<li><strong>not opening email attachments from people you don't know</strong> even when they appear to be harmless things like screensavers or videos.</li>
</ul>
