			<h3>Allow us to introduce ourselves.</h3>
			<p>Mozilla Corporation is part of a vast open-source software development project fueled by a small (but growing) staff and thousands of contributors and volunteers. We’re part of a vibrant community that helps support the openness, innovation and opportunity of the Internet.</p>
			<p>The award-winning Firefox web browser enables hundreds of millions of people worldwide to explore the Web through an ever-evolving window.</p>
			<p>Our technology is used as a platform for many of the Web’s most innovative projects. Many people think of us as a key part of what makes the Web tick - and what will keep it ticking in the future.</p>

			<h3>We’re a nice bunch.</h3>
			<p>Mozilla employees catch on fast. We’re driven by innovation and freedom, and are comfortable with change. Mozilla’s culture engages employees, encourages collaboration and thrives on ideas and ambitions.</p>
			<p>Mozilla is all about talented people working to improve the Web - it defines our past, our future and our average workday. Want to join us? Tell us why and send your resume to <em>careers at mozilla dot com</em>.</p>

			<h3>It’s a totally unique experience.</h3>
			<p>Working at Mozilla is never dull. As a small, open source organization with a worldwide impact, we count on each employee to innovate and implement ideas that make a difference on a very large scale. In other words, everyone contributes.</p>
			<p>We like to enjoy ourselves, too. When we’re not building a platform to improve the Web, we’ve been known to take in Giants games, have company kickball matches and throw the occasional backyard BBQ. Not to mention the Wii tennis tournaments, so sharpen up those skills…</p>
