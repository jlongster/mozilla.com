    <h2>Firefox <span>Notices</span></h2>
    <p>Mozilla Firefox is free and open source software, built by a community of thousands from all over the world. There are a few things you should know:</p>
</div>

<div id="main-content">

<ul>
  <li>Firefox is made available to you under the terms of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">Mozilla Public License</a>. This means you may use, copy and distribute Firefox to others.  You are also welcome to modify the source code of Firefox as you want to meet your needs. The Mozilla Public License also gives you the right to distribute your modified versions.</li>
  <li>Mozilla does not grant you any rights to the Mozilla and Firefox trademarks or logos. Additional information on Trademarks may be found <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Privacy policies for Mozilla's products may be found <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/legal/privacy/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Firefox also offers optional web site information services, such as the SafeBrowsing service; however, we cannot guarantee they are 100% accurate or error-free. More details, including information on how to disable the services, can be found in the service terms (below).</li>
</ul>


  <div id="website-services-agreements" class="expander expander-odd">
    <h3 class="expander-header">Mozilla Firefox Website Services Agreement</h3>
    <div class="expander-content">
		<p>Mozilla Firefox uses web site information services ("Services"), such as the SafeBrowsing service, that are available for your use with this binary version of Firefox as described below. If you do not want to use the Services or the terms below are unacceptable, you may disable the SafeBrowsing service by opening the application preferences, selecting the <code>Security</code> section, and unchecking the options for "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected attack site" and "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected forgery"</p>

		<ol>
		<li>Mozilla and its contributors, licensors and partners work to provide the most accurate and up-to-date phishing and malware information. However, they cannot guarantee that this information is comprehensive and error-free: some risky sites may not be identified and some safe sites may be identified in error.</li>
		<li>Mozilla may discontinue or change the Services at its discretion.</li>
		<li>You are welcome to use these Services with the accompanying version of Firefox, and you have all the rights necessary to do so.  Mozilla and its licensors reserve all other rights in the Services.  These terms are not intended to limit any rights granted under open source licenses applicable to Firefox and to corresponding source code versions of Firefox.</li>
		<li><strong>The Services are provided "as-is."  Mozilla, its contributors, licensors, and distributors, disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, warranties that the Services are merchantable and fit for your particular purposes.  You bear the entire risk as to selecting the Services for your purposes and as to the quality and performance of the Services. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Except as required by law, Mozilla, its contributors, licensors, and distributors will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in any way relating to the use of Firefox and the Services.  The collective liability under these terms will not exceed $500 (five hundred dollars). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.</strong></li>
		<li>Mozilla may update these terms as necessary from time to time. These terms may not be modified or cancelled without Mozilla's written agreement.</li>
		<li>These terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the English language version shall control.</li>
