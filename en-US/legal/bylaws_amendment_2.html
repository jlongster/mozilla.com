I further certify that on November 10, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously amended the Bylaws of the Company (the “Bylaws”), and that the following are the amendments to the Bylaws, and this Second Amendment to the Bylaws is in effect as of the date hereof:</p>

<h2>ARTICLE IV.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS.</h2>

<p>“Section 2.	<strong>Number, Tenure and Qualifications</strong>.  The number of directors that shall constitute the whole board shall be not more than seven (7) nor fewer than two (2).  The exact number of directors may be fixed from time to time within such limit by a duly adopted resolution of the shareholders.  The exact number of directors presently shall be four (4) until changed within the limits specified above by a duly adopted resolution of the shareholders.  Directors need not be shareholders.</p>

<p>Directors shall hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their respective successors are elected.
