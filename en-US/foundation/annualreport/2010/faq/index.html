        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>How does Mozilla measure success?</h3>
        <p>We  measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health  of the open Web. Mozilla achieves success by helping more people make  choices about what software they want to use, what level of  participation they would like to have online, and how to take part in building a better Internet. When we see growth in community contributors, software localizations, and a competitive browser market, for example, we know we are moving toward our goals.</p>
        <h3>How does being a mission-driven, nonprofit change the way you approach the market?</h3>
        <p>Our  status as a mission-driven, nonprofit organization fundamentally  affects our approach. It liberates us and allows us to focus, and take a  long-term view on building a better Internet and developing a vibrant,  creative community, rather than on traditional market concerns such as stock value. Growth in revenue and market share are simply indicators of  the great things built by the Mozilla project rather than being objectives in themselves.</p>
        <h3>How does Mozilla generate revenue?</h3>
        <p>The  majority of Mozilla's revenue is generated from search functionality  included in our Firefox product through all major search partners  including Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Amazon, Ebay and others.  Mozilla's reported revenue also include very important individual and corporate donations and grants as well as other forms of income from our investable assets.</p>        <h3>What was Mozilla's total revenue for 2010?</h3>
        <p>Mozilla's consolidated reported revenue (Mozilla Foundation and all subsidiaries) for 2010 was more than $104 million, up approximately 34 percent from 2008 reported revenue. [NEED TO UPDATE WITH 2010 INFO]</p>
        <h3>Does Mozilla's relationship with Google affect the organization's independence?</h3>
        <p>Our  employees and community members frequently collaborate on Web standards  and other issues of shared importance to our organizations with others,  including Google. Our mission and development process, however, are  completely unrelated to the revenue we earn from Google's search  activity . Our open development process is governed by Mozilla's mission  and our commitment to improving the Web. We do not vet our initiatives  with Google.</p>
        <h3>What is the status of the organization's contract with Google?</h3>
        <p>We  have had a productive relationship with Google since 2004 and that  relationship remains healthy. To date, we have renewed our contract  three times, in 2005, 2006 and 2008. The current version extends through  2011. We believe that search providers will remain a solid generator of  revenue for Mozilla for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <h3>Will you renew the contract in 2011? </h3>
        <p>We are currently in the middle of contract negotiations with Google. </p>
        <h3>Are you exploring opportunities to diversify your revenue stream?</h3>
        <p>Mozilla  has always focused on building open products that people love, in ways  that are participatory, and then developing revenue to support that  work. For long-term financial viability, we will of course look  carefully at ways to diversify our revenue mix over time.  We'll  continue to build great products that help people enjoy the richness of  the Internet, and we're confident that this allows us to identify  appropriate sources of revenue diversification.</p>
        <h3>What are the key projects for Mozilla in the next year? How do you plan to influence the market going forward?</h3>
        <p>Mozilla  will continue to focus on the desktop browser space with a new focus on  Web initiatives that extend beyond the browser. In addition to Firefox  for mobile, the Mozilla team will be pushing forward on new initiatives  like Apps, Identity, Social, Boot to Gecko and more. More information  can be found on the Firefox vision statement here.</p>
        <h3>Do you see a continued need for a neutral player like Mozilla, now that the browser market has been revived?</h3>
        <p>Mozillaâ€™s public benefit mission allows us to be unique as an organization. Our nonprofit nature enables us to advocate for the user and remain committed tokeeping the Web open and participatory, rather than focusing on market share or profits.  While the desktop browser market is innovative and competitive, there  are other areas of Internet life where Mozilla needs to advocate for the  user and bring openness and interoperability, such as mobile browsing,  applications and identity. </p>
