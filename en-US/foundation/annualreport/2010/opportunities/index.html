            <h2>Opportunities and Challenges</h2>
            <p>Today we're living more of our lives online than ever before.</p>
            <p>This gives Mozilla the opportunity to build freedom and user sovereignty into more areas of life.  At the same time, advances in mobile technology move us toward several parallel worlds, each controlled by different giant commercial entities. This has a huge impact on business models and the kinds of innovation that are permitted. Hardware choices in the mobile space are influencing the software and technology available to developers, and on how those developers reach consumers and build products.  For consumers, these choices in turn directly affect their ability to control their data, identity and interactions.</p>
            <p>We have seen these kinds of threats before. Mozilla was born out of this type of environment, as a reaction to a world that looked beautiful at the beginning — but then showed how an Internet life controlled by a few giant companies is not a healthy one.</p>
            <p>That's why Mozilla believes that, in this new world, identity, apps and education initiatives are vitally important tools to protect the Web's health and serve our larger mission. They are opportunities to give more freedom to more people, and are responses to the challenges of the current era.</p>
            <p>We know that innovation thrives in diverse and competitive markets. We know that healthy markets must make room for upstarts that disrupt or upend the entire model that came before. We have seen giants try to crush the entrepreneurial spirit that flourishes on the Web, and we have seen these giants brought down.</p>
            <p>Mozilla built Firefox to do just that.  We wove the core Mozilla values of openness, transparency and interoperability into the fabric of the Internet and we now have a full set of new initiatives aimed at extending those values beyond the desktop to address today's setting.</p>
            <h2>Improving Web Capabilities</h2>
            <p>Mozilla has long been a leader in making the Internet more capable to make the Web <<awkard>> a rich and compelling standalone platform.  We continue this leadership today.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://identity.mozilla.com/">Identity</a></h3>
            <p>We're working to give people full control over how they identify themselves online.  Today's Web needs an open source, standards-based platform for universally accessible, decentralized, customized identity on the Web.  Mozilla has set about building it, with the BrowserID project as a first step.  Browser ID is a secure, decentralized, open source, cross-browser way to sign onto websites using your email address, which you can use in addition to identity services provided by social networking and other applications. </p>
            <h3><a href="https://apps.mozillalabs.com/">Apps</a></h3>
            <p>Apps represent a new, convenient way of interacting with the Internet. Today they are not very Web-centric and lack a number of the features that are great about the Web [http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2011/08/09/the-app-model-and-the-web/]. The Mozilla open ecosystem charts a course for integrating the exciting traits of apps with the richness of the Web. This new system will let users take their apps with them across platforms and devices. It will bridge contact lists and social graphs from different providers across the Web, rather than application to application. It will allow users to discover apps in open and flexible ways, just as we discover other content on the Web. In this world, both the browser and apps will link us to a universally accessible, interoperable Internet that encourages innovation without censorship. </p>
            <h3><a href="https://webfwd.org/">WebFWD</a></h3>
            <p>WebFWD (Web Forward) is an incubator program for people whose product ideas align with Mozilla values. It mentors groups of builders and innovators to create open solutions that push the Web forward. We provide a space at Mozilla, close mentorship from many leaders in the technology space and interaction with the Mozilla ecosystem. WebFWD offers a bootcamp environment (full-time in a Mozilla office for one month) and a Fellows program. Through this initiative, Mozilla is investing in helping others succeed, while building openness and user freedom into the fabric of the Web.</p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Mozilla's educational programs are designed to inspire a new generation of Webmakers,  giving people the skills they need to take full advantage of the open technology and culture of the Web. The School of Webcraft [http://p2pu.org/webcraft] is a free, online community that teaches open Web development skills through peer-to-peer collaboration and mentorship around the world.  The Mozilla Hackasaurus program  [http://hackasaurus.org/] teaches youth aged 12 to 17 the building blocks of Web technology and development, helping them move from passive digital consumers to active producers who see the Web as something they can shape, remix and make better.  This is just the beginning. Mozilla is also developing new approaches to recognizing online learning and 21st century skills through our Open Badges project (http://openbadges.org/), and designing programs that help young people get together locally and teach each other about the Web.</p>
            <h3>Media</h3>
            <p>Mozilla programs and tools are bringing openness and innovation to online media. These include Web Made Movies [http://webmademovies.org/], an open video lab that brings together filmmakers and Web developers to explore how browser technologies like HTML5 can create new storytelling potential and make video work more like the Web. Mozilla's partnership with the Knight Foundation brings together Web innovators, journalists and respected news organizations https://drumbeat.org/journalism to create ideas and software that drive innovation in journalism. Mozilla also supports efforts to make video more open, accessible and Web-native through projects like Universal Subtitles, [www.universalsubtitles.org/] the Open Video Alliance [http://openvideoalliance.org/] and the Bay Area Video Coalition [http://www.bavc.org/].</p>
            <h3>Boot to Gecko</h3>
            <p>Mozilla recently launched Boot to Gecko, an iniative intended to bring the underlying platform of the Web to mobile devices. The goal is to build a complete, standalone operating system based on open Web technologies and to create a better basis for future applications on mobile and desktop. Mozilla believes the Web can be an equal or better alternative to proprietary, single-vendor stacks for application development.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/privacy/">Privacy and Do Not Track</a></h3>
            <p>Mozilla believes it is crucial to put people in control of their personal Web interactions and experiences. As part of that ongoing effort, we developed the "Do Not Track" feature in Firefox for both desktop and mobile. Industry support quickly followed. Apple and Microsoft implemented the same solution into their browsers. The United States Federal Trade Commission publicly supported Do Not Track, and the Vice President of the European Commission called for adoption of Do Not Track by 2012. We intend to build on our work in this area, and will continue to act as an advocate for the user, exploring new ways to bring transparency and user control to online user data collection methods.</p>
            
            <h2>A COMPETITIVE WORLD</h2>
            <p>Firefox demonstrated just how important browsers are, and now other players have entered the market. A few are new venture-backed companies. For them, finding a path to massive distribution will be a big challenge. Google is in a different position, with a good product, a significant advertising program and the ability to include its browser offering with other Google sites and products. Competition is good — it makes all of us do our best — but it's important to remember that the reasons for building Web browsers are significantly different from one company to the next. Mozilla is unique in the market in that we build Firefox to provide an independent offering focused solely on individual experience and the overall good of the Web.</p>
            <p>The challenge in this hotly competitive space is to make sure the Web remains interoperable. We've seen a few instances of companies building (or advertising) products as working only in a specific browser, when they actually work in many different ones. We've seen this pattern before, too; both Netscape and Microsoft followed this model. It was terrible for the overall health of the Internet and we don't want to see it happen again. </p>
            <p>To prevent this, Mozilla has a variety of activities underway: </p>
            <p>The first is making Firefox better. We've streamlined our processes to get new capabilities in the hands users and developers more often. In the past, it took Mozilla 18 months or so to deliver new features. This year we moved to a six-week release cycle to keep our product updated more effectively. There's more work to be done to make sure the new schedule works for everyone, but we've overcome the great hurdle of changing a process that served us well during our first decade.</p>
            <p>We've. [list the 3 or 5 things the product group wants to say about Firefox.] We began including Android as a first tier platform along with our desktop platforms.</p>
            <p>We're also working to make it easy for the developer ecosystem to make it easier to avoid browser-specific implementations. [NEED MORE HERE?] </p>
            <p>We also have a set of initiatives to further empower the Mozilla community, which is described in the next section.</p>
