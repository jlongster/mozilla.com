<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>We are pleased to share with you this year’s annual State of Mozilla report. It details our opportunities and challenges, expanding set of initiatives, community and 2010 financials.</p>
<p>People are living more of their lives online and Mozilla’s role is expanding to keep these new onramps to the Web open, transparent, and interoperable. We believe that all people on this planet should benefit from the power of the Web and have control over their online experiences.</p>
<p>We invite you to learn more about the Mozilla Project and join us in our ongoing efforts to build a better Internet.</p>
