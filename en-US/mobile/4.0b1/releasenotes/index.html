        <h3 class="expander-header">What's new in Firefox 4 Beta 1 for Android and Maemo</h3>
        <div class="expander-content">
          <p><em>Fennec is the codename of Mozilla’s mobile project, however,
          the official product name is Firefox.</em></p>

          <p>Shipping with many of your favorite Firefox desktop features
          like Firefox Sync, Add-ons and the Awesome Bar, this beta release
          brings Firefox to the Android platform, the fastest growing
          smartphone platform in the world.</p>

          <p>The foundation of this release is based on enhanced
          performance and responsiveness, specifically around a technology
          called “Layers” that greatly improves performance in graphic intensive
          actions like scrolling, zooming and animations. Enhanced
          responsiveness, in conjunction with new and improved features that
          help customize your Firefox, make this release a user
          friendly and personalized experience.</p>

          <em>Get Up and Go</em>
          <p>
          Shipping with the Firefox Sync feature built-in, Firefox 4 beta 1 synchronizes
          your Firefox history, bookmarks, open tabs, passwords and form data
          between your desktop and mobile. Just login with your Firefox Sync
          account info and Firefox gets to know you right away, taking you to
          your favorite parts of the Web with barely any typing. Don't worry
          about switching to a new phone, or having to type long URLs or
          passwords again. You can even leave your desktop in a moment’s notice
          and pick up right where you left off on your mobile phone.
          </p>

          <em>Add-ons</em>
          <p>
          Firefox 4 Beta 1 offers add-ons;
          pieces of software that let you change or add features, functionality
          and the look of your Firefox to fit your browsing lifestyle. You can
          search for and install add-ons directly to your Android phone or
          Nokia N900 from the Add-ons Manager located in your browser tools.  We
          look forward to offering more add-ons in future releases.
          </p>

          <em>Personalized Start Page</em>
          <p>
          Pick up where you left off with your new personalized Start page. Get
          instant access to your Firefox desktop tabs, the tabs you had open
          last time you were browsing on your phone, the Awesome Bar, and get
          suggestions for useful add-ons.
          </p>

          <em>Awesome Screen</em>
          <p>
          The Awesome Screen pops up just by tapping on the Awesome Bar
          (location bar). It gets to know you and instantly brings up a smart
          list of your favourite history items and bookmarks and lets you
          easily select a search engine for your desired search. You can also
          customize your search engine list for maximum efficiency.
          </p>

          <em>Touch Friendly UI</em>
          <p>
          Swipe to the left or right of your screen to access your tabs,
          browser controls and tools, which are stowed out of the way while you
          browse the Web. Typing on a phone is hard, that's why you can
          bookmark a site with one tap, view tabs as thumbnails to easily see
          and open the page you want, and use the Awesome Screen to get to
          where you want to go in just a few a keystrokes.
          </p>

          <em>Responsiveness</em>
          <p>
          Speed and responsiveness is one of the major focuses of this release.
          This has been implemented using two major technologies, “Electrolysis”
          and “Layers.”  Electrolysis allows the browser interface to run in a
          separate process from the one rendering Web content, reacting much
          faster to user input while pages are loading or CPU intensive
          JavaScript is running. This release has taken advantage of Layers to
          improve performance in graphic intensive actions like
          scrolling, zooming and animations.
          </p>

          <p>More personalized than ever before, Firefox 4 beta 1 is packed with
          your favorite features and great improvements. Other highlights
          include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pinch-to-zoom (Android), double-tap, or use the volume rocker
            (Nokia N900) to zoom in and out</li>
            <li>Tabbed browsing in thumbnail view lets you easily see and open
            the site you want</li>
            <li>Location-Aware Browsing gives you content and info relevant to
            your location</li>
            <li>Find in Page in the Site Menu lets you quickly find text on the
            webpage</li>
            <li>Share Page in the Site Menu lets you send content to email,
            Facebook, Twitter and Google Reader</li>
            <li>Forget Password in the Site Menu tells a website you no longer
            trust to forget your private data</li>
            <li>Add Search Engine in the Site Menu lets you quickly add a new
            search engine to your Awesome Screen</li>
            <li>Context Menu lets you Open in New Tab and Share by long tapping
            and holding a link</li>
            <li>Smart Tapping lets you tap on links, widgets and other Web
            content with accuracy</li>
            <li>Password Manager lets you choose to remember site password to
            avoid typing</li>

          Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same
          technology platform, there are differences that will require
          developers to make changes to their add-ons in order to become

            <ul>
              <li>Firefox 4 beta 1 requires around 40 MB of internal storage. We have
              plans to reduce this to 20 MB or less. Like all Android NDK apps,
              Firefox must copy its native libraries out of the APK file before
              loading them, so they end up installed twice. We have plans to
              work around this problem and reduce the installation size (<a

                <dd>
                Add-ons are small
                pieces of software that let you add or change the look or
                functionality of Firefox. Install add-ons directly to your
                Firefox by swiping to the left and tapping on the browser tools
                "gear" button on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, then
                choosing the add-ons “puzzle piece” button to discover and
                install the add-ons that are most useful to you.

                   Firefox Sync is a built-in feature of Firefox 4 beta that lets you
                   synchronize your desktop and mobile data. To use this
                   feature, you must first <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868/">install the Firefox Sync add-on</a>  on
                   your desktop and create a Firefox Sync account. Then go to
                   Firefox on your mobile phone, tap on the browser tools,
                   Add-ons Manager and select Firefox Sync. Tap "Connect," and
                   enter your Firefox Sync login info to begin synchronizing.

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Firefox 4 beta on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.  If you do wish to start using Firefox Sync on your
                  mobile phone, remember you must first install the Firefox
                  Sync add-on to your desktop and create an account.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the

                  require developers to make changes to their add-ons in order

                <dt>What browser engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 2.0b7pre,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.
                  
                <dt>What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox includes the new “<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/jagermonkey/">JaegerMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The JaegerMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like

                <dd>
                  There is no plugin support in Firefox 4 beta 1 for Android and Nokia
                  N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins for experimentation and testing purposes only. We are
                  working on ways for the user to have control of which sites
                  to enable plugins for, as some sites, like YouTube, do work
                  quite well.
