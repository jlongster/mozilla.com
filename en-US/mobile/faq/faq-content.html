    <dd>Firefox for Android is built on the same technology
    platform as Firefox for the desktop, making it fast, easy to use
    and customizable. Firefox includes Firefox Sync to bring your
    desktop history, bookmarks, open tabs, passwords and form data
    across computers and mobile devices. Add-ons let you customize the
    look and functionality of Firefox, and the Awesome Screen helps
    you get where you’re going on the Web

    <dd>
      Location-Aware Browsing is one of the new features in the HTML5
      specification which enables a website to ask for your permission
      to share your location in order to offer personalized features
      (see ‘Features” below). The browser will only use your location
      if you have granted a website permission to do so. It is not
      used for any other purpose or without your knowledge.

    <dt id="q11">How do I use the Firefox user interface to browse the Web?</dt>
    <dd>
      Firefox browser controls are stowed away to the sides of the
      screen to save space on your phone’s display. They can be
      accessed by swiping your finger left or right across the
      screen. Your tabs are on the left side of the screen, while
      bookmarks and settings are on the right. To let you see more of
      a given site, the address bar also disappears when you scroll
      down, but it’s quickly retrieved by swiping up or to the side.

    <dd>
      The Awesome Screen appears by tapping the Awesome Bar (Smart
      Location Bar). As you type it will display websites that you
      have recently visited or bookmarked. The Awesome Screen learns
      as you use it, adapting to your preferences and giving you

      Firefox Add-ons let you customize the look, features and
      functionality of Firefox to personalize your browsing
      experience. Select the settings gear at the bottom right of your
      screen, then choose the add-ons puzzle piece. You can search for
      and install the add-ons that are most useful to you directly
      from your phone. Firefox will also recommend add-ons on your
      personalized Start page.

      <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/mobile/sync/">Firefox Sync</a>
      brings your Firefox desktop experience to your mobile phone. It
      allows you to securely access your Firefox history, bookmarks,

    </dd>

    <dt id="q18">How do I use Firefox Sync?</dt>
    <dd>
      First, create an account on your Firefox on your desktop
      computer. Then go to Firefox on your mobile and connect your
      devices by tapping Tools » Preferences » Setup Sync. A
      single-use sync code will appear. This code will be put into the
      Firefox menu on your desktop. Select Firefox » Options » Sync »
      Activate New Device and enter your sync code. Watch the

    </dd>

    <dt id="q19">How does Firefox Sync protect data?</dt>
    <dd>
      Firefox Sync employs a system called “end-to-end”
      encryption. Firefox Sync asks you for a unique password which it
      then uses to create a key for encrypting your data. This
      password is known only to you and it remains only on your
      device, so that nobody can use it to read your data. For more
      information on how Firefox Sync protects your security and
      privacy, see
      the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?=$lang?>/mobile/sync/">Firefox
      Sync page</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt id="q20">What is Location-Aware Browsing?</dt>
    <dd>
      Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites to
      ask you where you are. If you choose to share your location with
      a website, it can use that information to find nearby points of
      interest and return additional, useful data like maps of your
      area. It’s all optional – Firefox doesn’t share your location
      without your permission. Learn more
      about <a href="#">Location-Aware Browsing</a> and view the
      <a href="#">privacy policy</a> from the Google Location Service.
    </dd>

    <dt id="q20a">How accurate are the locations?</dt>
    <dd>
      Accuracy varies greatly from location to location. In some
      places, our service providers may be able to provide a location
      within a few meters. However, in other areas it might be much
      more than that. All locations returned by our service providers
      are estimates only and we do not guarantee the accuracy of the
      locations provided.

    <dt id="q20b">Does Firefox on my phone support plugins like Flash?</dt>

    <dt>How does Firefox protect my privacy?</dt>
    <dd>
      Firefox for Android is the first mobile Web browser to offer
      the Do Not Track privacy feature to give you more control over
      the way your browsing behavior is tracked and used online.
    </dd>

    <dt>How does Do Not Track work?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Do Not Track lets you tell websites that you want to opt-out
         of online behavioral tracking. To turn Do Not Track on, simply
         go to the Preferences option in Browser Tools on Firefox for
         Android and tap the box “tell sites not to track me.”</p>
      <p>When this option is selected "Yes," a HTTP header will be sent
         signaling to websites that you wish to opt-out of online
         behavioral tracking. You will not notice any difference in
         your browsing experience until sites and advertisers start
         responding to the header. Visit the Mozilla Do Not Track
         site for more info.</p>

      Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the

      developers to make changes to their add-ons. These changes are
      usually straightforward. Visit
