        <h3 class="expander-header">What's new in Fennec Alpha for Android and Nokia N900</h3>
        <div class="expander-content">
          <p><em>Fennec is the codename of Mozilla’s mobile project, however,
          the official product name is Firefox. For pre-beta releases of
          Firefox, we refer to it by the project's name, Fennec. This is an
          alpha release of Fennec.</em></p>

          <p>Built on the same technology platform as Firefox 4 for desktop
          computers, Fennec is designed and optimized for browsing on a mobile
          device, yet ships with many of your favorite Firefox desktop features
          like Firefox Sync, Add-ons and the Awesome Bar.  This alpha release
          brings Fennec to the Android platform, the fastest growing
          smartphone platform in the world.</p>

          <p>The foundation of this release is based on enhanced responsiveness
          and increased stability, in conjunction with new and improved
          features that focus on customizing the browser to fit the individual
          exactly:</p>

          <em>Get Up and Go</em>
          <p>
          Shipping with the Firefox Sync feature built-in, Fennec synchronizes
          your Firefox history, bookmarks, open tabs, passwords and form data
          between your desktop and mobile. Just login with your Firefox Sync
          account info and Fennec gets to know you right away, taking you to
          your favorite parts of the Web with barely any typing. Don't worry
          about switching to a new phone, or having to type long URLs or
          passwords again. You can even leave your desktop in a moment’s notice
          and pick up right where you left off on your mobile phone.
          </p>

          <em>Add-ons</em>
          <p>
          Fennec is the world's first mobile Web browser to support add-ons;
          pieces of software that let you change or add features, functionality
          and the look of your Fennec to fit your browsing lifestyle. You can
          search for and install add-ons directly to your Android phone or
          Nokia N900 from the Add-ons Manager located in your browser tools.
          </p>

          <em>Personalized Start Page</em>
          <p>
          The Start Page gives you a snapshot of your online life while you’ve
          been away.  Pick up where you left off with instant access to your
          Firefox desktop data, the tabs you had open last time you were
          browsing on your phone, and get suggestions for useful add-ons.
          Comign soon: See alerts of recent activity from your email accounts
          and your favorite social media sites!
          </p>

          <em>Awesome Screen</em>
          <p>
          The Awesome Screen pops up just by tapping on the Awesome Bar
          (location bar). It gets to know you and instantly brings up a smart
          list of your favourite history items and bookmarks and lets you
          easily select a search engine for your desired search. You can also
          customize your search engine list for maximum efficiency.
          </p>

          <em>Touch Friendly UI</em>
          <p>
          Swipe to the left or right of your screen to access your tabs,
          browser controls and tools, which are stowed out of the way while you
          browse the Web. Typing on a phone is hard, that's why you can
          bookmark a site with one tap, view tabs as thumbnails to easily see
          and open the page you want, and use the Awesome Screen to get to
          where you want to go in just a few a keystrokes.
          </p>

          <em>Responsiveness</em>
          <p>
          Responsiveness is one of the major focuses for this release.  We've
          redesigned Gecko to allow us to run the UI in a separate process from
          the web content which enables us to react much faster to user actions
          like scrolling and zooming.
          </p>

          <p>More personalized than ever before, Fennec is packed with your
          favorite features and great improvements. Other highlights include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pinch-to-zoom (Android), double-tap, or use the volume rocker
            (Nokia N900) to zoom in and out</li>
            <li>Tabbed browsing in thumbnail view lets you easily see and open
            the site you want</li>
            <li>Location-Aware Browsing gives you content and info relevant to
            your location</li>
            <li>Save to PDF in the Site Menu lets you capture important
            content, like driving directions or a boarding pass, to view
            offline</li>
            <li>Find in Page in the Site Menu lets you quickly find text on the
            webpage</li>
            <li>Share Page in the Site Menu lets you send content to email,
            Facebook, Twitter and Google Reader</li>
            <li>Forget Password in the Site Menu tells a website you no longer
            trust to forget your private data</li>
            <li>Add Search Engine in the Site Menu lets you quickly add a new
            search engine to your Awesome Screen</li>
            <li>Context Menu lets you Open in New Tab and Share by long tapping
            and holding a link</li>
            <li>Smart Tapping lets you tap on links, widgets and other Web
            content with accuracy</li>
            <li>Password Manager lets you choose to remember site password to
            avoid typing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These improvements build upon the features and additions in the <a

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Fennec on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.  If you do wish to start using Firefox Sync on your
                  mobile phone, remember you must first install the Firefox
                  Sync add-on to your desktop and create an account.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                <dd>
                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same platform,
                  there are small differences that will require developers to make changes to their add-ons.
                  These changes are usually straightforward,

                <dt>What browser engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 1.9.3,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?
                  Firefox includes the new “<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/tracemonkey-overview/">TraceMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The TraceMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dt>How do I develop a Location-Aware website for Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox has implemented the first public draft of the
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">Geolocation specification from the W3C</a>.

                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like

                <dt>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins?</dt>
                <dd>
                  There is no plugin support in Fennec for Android and Nokia
                  N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins for experimentation and testing purposes only. We are
                  working on ways for the user to have control of which sites
                  to enable plugins for, as some sites, like YouTube, do work
                  quite well.
