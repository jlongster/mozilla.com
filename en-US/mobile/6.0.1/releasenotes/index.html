          <h5>Build Add-ons for Mobile</h5>
          <p>
          Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same
          technology platform, there are differences that will require
          developers to make changes to their add-ons in order to become
          compatible with Firefox for Android.
          </p>
          <p>With this new release we now support <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">Restartless Add-ons</a>. Visit the <a
          href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions/Electrolysis">Electrolysis

          </p>
          <h5>What’s Under the Hood</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>The same browser engine as Firefox for desktop</li>
            <li>Fast JavaScript engine, using Mozilla’s J&auml;gerMonkey
            just-in-time compiler</li>
            <li>Leading web standards compatibility</li>
            <li>Optimized for ARM processors</li>
            <li>Location-Aware Browsing</li>
          </ul>
          <em>HTML5 and other web standards:</em>
          <ul>
            <li>Web workers</li>
            <li>Offline storage</li>

          </ul>
          <p>In addition, Firefox for Android supports:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IPv6 on Android</li>
    <li>"overflow: scroll" and "overflow: auto" CSS properties</li>

          <h3 class="expander-header">Known Issues</h3>
          <div class="expander-content">
            <p>This list covers some of the known problems with Firefox for Android which will be resolved in future versions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Layout issues with Google+ and other Google properties: some recent changes in the Google layout and CSS may cause issues in non-webkit browsers like Firefox. We are working with Google on the problem (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=668218"> bug 668218</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=668288"> bug 668288</a>)</li>
                <li>Blinking characters in form fields (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665374">bug 665374</a>)</li>
                <li>Asus Transformer keyboard deletes two characters (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662219">bug 662219</a>)</li>
                <li>Asus Transformer hardware keyboard is always en-US (see <a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=669361">bug 669361</a>)</li>
                <li>Unable to zoom in/out a webpage on header/footer when a double tap gesture is made (see  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=639504">bug 639504</a>)</li>
                <li>In some languages other than English, Browser Preference and notification buttons don't fit on the screen in portrait mode (see <a href=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=661889">bug 661889</a>). This is fixed in Firefox 7 ('Firefox Beta' in Android Market)</li>
                <li>Searches from the URL bar do not function reliably for some locales (see  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=645970">bug 645970</a>)</li>
                <li>For some users HTML5 video may load slowly and display rendering artifacts on the screen during playback (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622839">bug 622839</a>)</li>
                <li>Reloading a page increases the zoom level (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=628269">bug 628269</a>)</li>
                <li>Users who have a large desktop profile using Firefox Sync may see some performance issues during the initial sync process</li>
                <li>We found an extremely rare case where the browser may become unable to load web pages or close tabs. This should not happen in normal operation (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676780">bug 676780</a>), but we are working on a solution. Clearing the browser profile (Settings -> Applications -> Clear Data) resolves it, but may remove useful browser data like bookmarks and web history. Recommendation: use <a href="https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/sync-firefox-between-desktop-and-mobile">Firefox Sync</a> for a seamless web experience across all your devices that run Firefox.</li>
                <li>Adobe Flash and other plugins are not supported. Currently, enabling the Flash plugin results in a compromised user experience across Firefox for mobile</li>

                   Firefox Sync is a built-in feature of Firefox that lets you
                   synchronize your desktop and mobile data. To use this
                   feature, you must first install  <a  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/">Firefox for the desktop (version 4 or higher)</a>. Then go to Tools, Set Up Sync and   follow  the  prompts to create a Sync Account. Once you have an account   on your   desktop, go to Firefox on your mobile phone, tap on Browser Tools button. Scroll down the Preferences pane and tap Connect  under the Sync section. A one-time code will appear. Go back to your Sync account info, select “Add Device” and enter the code from your phone.

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Firefox on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.

                <dt>What are the trade-offs to using Firefox Sync in Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                   Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is still in its experimental phase. Those who use Firefox Sync and who have  large desktop profiles, may detect performance issues on their mobile.  We are working to resolve this in future releases.
                </dd>
                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 6,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.
                  
                <dt>What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox includes the new “<a  href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/jagermonkey/">JaegerMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The JaegerMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dt>How do I develop a Location-Aware website for Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox has implemented the first public draft of the
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">Geolocation specification from the W3C</a>.

                <dt>Does Firefox on my mobile support HTML 5?</dt>
                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like
                  <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/geolocation/">Location-Aware browsing</a>,
                  the <a  href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/pushing-pixels-with-canvas/">&lt;canvas&gt;</a>

                <dt>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins?</dt>
                <dd>
                  There is currently no plugin support in Firefox for Android, and plugins are disabled in Firefox for Nokia N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin on Nokia N900 didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins in Firefox for Nokia N900 for experimentation and testing only.
