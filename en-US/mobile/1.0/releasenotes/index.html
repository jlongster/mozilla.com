            <ul>
              <li> The Awesome Bar: The Smart Location Bar, or "Awesome Bar" gets you where you want to go with minimal typing. Touch the Awesome Bar and begin typing.

Weave Sync synchronizes your Firefox history, saved passwords, bookmarks and open tabs between your desktop and Nokia N900. With Weave Sync, the Awesome Bar knows your browsing history regardless of which device you visited it on – home desktop, work laptop, or Nokia N900, so you can leverage years of desktop browsing on the first day you fire up your mobile device -- even your saved passwords from your desktop can be used to automatically fill out forms. Weave Sync's Get Up and Go feature lets you surf the Web on your desktop, get up and go, and have your open tabs ready and waiting for you on your mobile – just as you left them on your computer

          </p>


            <em>Personalized Browsing</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/mobile">Add-ons</a>: Customize your Firefox by adding features that help make your browser your own. Firefox is the first mobile Web browser to support add-ons. Add-ons like AdBlock Plus, URL Fixer, TwitterBar, language translators, and geo guides become especially handy when you’re out and about on your mobile. You can both discover and install add-ons directly from your Nokia N900. There are currently more than 40 Firefox add-ons available for mobile and the number is growing every day</li>
              <li> Set your Preferences: Access your browser tools with one touch to get more Firefox product information, change languages (we support more than 35 and counting), manage content and privacy settings</li>
              <li> Download manager: Download any file to your N900. The download manager shows download progress visually, will download in the background while you continue browsing, enables multiple simultaneous downloads, and enables you to stop, pause or resume downloads. Helper applications like the PDF reader will automatically launch if needed</li>
            </ul>

            <em>Private and Secure</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> Customized security settings: Customize settings for passwords, cookies, loading images and installing add-ons for a fully empowered mobile browsing experience</li>
              <li> Instant Web site ID ("<a href="http://www.dria.org/wordpress/archives/2008/05/06/635/">Larry</a>"): Tap on a site favicon for an instant identity overview</li>
              <li> Password manager: Typing passwords on your phone is hard. Choose to remember site passwords and avoid long and difficult typing</li>
              <li> Popup blocker: Banish pop-ups from your surfing experience once and for all</li>
              <li> Clear private data: As an extra security measure, you can clear all your private data via your Preferences</li>
              <li> Automated Update: You will receive notifications as soon as updates to Firefox are available. Install them right away, or wait until you're ready</li>
            </ul>

            <em>Under the hood</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> 
                Leading Web Compatibility: Firefox for mobile gives 
                Web developers more tools and features to create the 
                next big breakthroughs in mobile Web content. 
                Using open standards like 
                <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/?s=html5">HTML5</a>, 
                <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/css/">CSS</a> and 
                <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/javascript/">JavaScript</a>, developers can create fast, powerful, beautiful applications, and even tap into the unique capabilities of mobile devices like camera, geolocation and device orientation</li>
              <li> Fast JavaScript engine: Uses Mozilla's "TraceMonkey" just-in-time compiler, optimized for ARM processors</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/">Location-Aware Browsing</a>: Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites to ask you where you are. It’s all optional – Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission</li>
              <li> Offline Browsing: Even if your mobile phone doesn’t have a Web connection, you can still have information at your fingertips. Certain enabled sites may allow applications—like your Web-based email—to stay with you at all times </li>
              <li> Next-Generation Graphics: The rendering of text and graphics, including 
              <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/svg/">SVG</a> and 
              <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/canvas/">Canvas</a>, is faster and sharper than ever before, thanks to our upgraded graphics engine. Firefox automatically color corrects images that have the color profile data included (like your digital photos) to make sure the colors are exactly as intended</li>
            </ul>

            <em>A Global Community</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> Set your Language: Firefox for mobile is offered in more than 35 languages and counting. It's been built and tested by a global community of people creating a better Internet</li>
              <li> These local communities have gone beyond translation  and may have also customized your Firefox browsing experience with local dictionaries and search providers</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Initially, Firefox for N900 does not support browser plug-ins. Due to performance problems using Adobe Flash within Firefox on many websites, especially those with multiple plug-ins on them, we have disabled plugins for Firefox for Maemo 1.0. We plan to provide a browser add-on that will enable you to selectively enable plugins on certain sites, because some sites, like YouTube, work well. 
              </li>
              <li>
                While a Web page is loading (the page info icon 
                will display as a turning circle), interaction 
                with the Web page such as panning 
                and zooming has limited responsiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                Firefox is intended for use on the Nokia N900. 
                It can also be run on the Nokia N810 and N800 Internet Tablets, 
                but these devices are significantly less powerful, 
                and performance will degrade accordingly. 
                We don't recommend Firefox for these devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                We provide desktop builds (Windows, OS X, Linux) 
                of Firefox for mobile devices to support localizers, 
                add-on developers and others who want to experiment, 
                but don't have access to supported devices. 
                These builds are not intended for general use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add-ons built based upon earlier beta releases 
                may depend upon interfaces that have been deprecated, 
                and therefore may not install properly. 
                Add-on developers are encouraged to check 
                that their add-ons work with the Release Candidate build.

                  No. Although we think that syncing Firefox between your PC and mobile with Weave Sync is highly useful, it is an optional service that you can choose to use or not. You will still be able to break in your Firefox mobile Web browser with the Awesome Bar, which remembers where you go and how often, getting to your favorite sites very quickly.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites 
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your 
                  location with a website, it can use that information to 
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional, 
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional – 
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                <dd>
                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same platform, 
                  there are small differences that will require developers to make changes to their add-ons. 
                  These changes are usually straightforward,

                <dt>What browser engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine. 
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 1.9.2,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever 
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance, 
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?
                  Firefox includes the new “<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/tracemonkey-overview/">TraceMonkey</a>” 
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology. 
                  The TraceMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it, 
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dt>How do I develop a Location-Aware website for Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox has implemented the first public draft of the 
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">Geolocation specification from the W3C</a>.

                <dt>Does Firefox on my mobile support HTML 5?</dt>
                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML. 
                  The HTML 5 specification is an ongoing work, 
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features 
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative 
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like

                <dt>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Support for plugins in Firefox for Maemo has been disabled. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the performance of the plugin didn't meet our standards, and the interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable plugins for experimentation and testing purposes only.  We plan to provide a browser add-on that will enable you to selectively enable plugins on certain sites, because some sites, like YouTube, work well.
