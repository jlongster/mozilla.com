Beta 5 is a very important step towards our final release, even though we did not add any major features in this release. Based on all the great user feedback we have received, we decided to focus on making the browser more stable, usable, and performance with this version:

<li>Add-ons<ul>
    <li>There are now over 100 <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/mobile">add-ons</a> for Firefox for mobile, and counting. Check out the  winners of our <a=href="http://blog.mozilla.com/mobile/2011/01/20/congrats-mobile-add-ons-cup-winners/">Mobile Add-on Cup</a> and many other awesome extensions for your mobile browser.

  <li>User Interface<ul>
  <li>No major changes in this release compared to Beta 4, as we focused mostly on stability, usability, and performance</li>

          <p>
          Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same
          technology platform, there are differences that will require
          developers to make changes to their add-ons in order to become
          compatible with Firefox 4 Beta for Android and Maemo.
New:  We now support <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">restartless  add-ons</a>. Visit the <a

                   feature, you must first install  <a  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/">Firefox 4 Beta for  the desktop</a>. Then go to Tools, Set Up Sync and follow the  prompts to create a Sync Account. Once you have an account on your  desktop, go to Firefox on your mobile phone, tap on Browser Tools  button. Scroll down the Preferences pane and tap Connect  under the Sync  section. A one-time code will appear. Go back to your Sync account  info, select “Add Device” and enter the code from your phone.

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Firefox 4 Beta on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.

                <dt>What are the trade-offs to using Firefox Sync in Firefox 4 Beta?</dt>
                <dd>
                Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is  still in its experimental phase. Those who use Firefox Sync and who have  large desktop profiles, may detect performance issues on their mobile.  We are working to resolve this in future releases.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the

                  require developers to make changes to their add-ons in order

                <dt>What browser engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 4.0b8,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.
                  
                <dt>What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox includes the new “<a  href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/jagermonkey/">JaegerMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The JaegerMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dt>How do I develop a Location-Aware website for Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox has implemented the first public draft of the
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">Geolocation specification from the W3C</a>.

                <dt>Does Firefox on my mobile support HTML 5?</dt>
                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like
                  <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/geolocation/">Location-Aware browsing</a>,

                <dt>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins?</dt>
                <dd>
                  There is no plugin support in Firefox 4 Beta for Android, and plugins are disable in Firefox 4 Beta for Nokia
                  N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin on Nokia N900 didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins in Firefox for Nokia N900 for experimentation and testing only.
