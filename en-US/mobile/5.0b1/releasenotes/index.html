          <em>Build add-ons for mobile</em>
          <p>
          Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same
          technology platform, there are differences that will require
          developers to make changes to their add-ons in order to become
          compatible with Firefox for Android.
New:  We now support <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">Restartless Add-ons</a>. Visit the <a

          </p>
          <em>What’s under the hood</em>
          <ul>
            <li>The same browser engine as Firefox for desktop</li>
            <li>Fast JavaScript engine, using Mozilla’s “JaegerMonkey”
            just-in-time compiler</li>
            <li>Leading Web compatibility</li>
            <li>Optimized for ARM processors</li>
            <li>Location-Aware Browsing</li>
          </ul>
          <em>HTML5 and other web standards:</em>

          <h3 class="expander-header">Known Issues</h3>
          <div class="expander-content">
            <ul>
            <li>In some cases, typing past the boundaries of the textbox will start clearing the beginning characters, instead of scrolling. Note: while characters seem to disappear, they are actually still in the respective input field and can be used as usual, e.g. to type in search terms, user names, or other form data. This can also happen in Firefox 4.0.1. and will be fixed in the full release, but is unresolved in the current Beta version. (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655852>Bug 655852</a>)</li>
<li>The password field is not masked when trying to type in your password (see <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=655864>Bug 655864</a>)</li>
                 <li>Users who have a large desktop profile using Firefox Sync may see some performance issues during the initial sync process. We are working to improve this in future releases.</li>
              <li>Developers who have not updated their add-ons for the latest version of Firefox, please see the
              <a  href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions/Electrolysis">Electrolysis and Add-ons wiki</a> and the <a  href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/AddonsTrainingWeek">Add-ons Training Week</a> documentation to help you make your add-on compatible with Firefox.
              </li>
                 <li>Adobe Flash and other plugins are not supported. Currently, enabling the Flash plugin results in a compromised user experience across Firefox for mobile. </li>
              <li>Users cannot edit content within documents or spreadsheets using Google Docs or Etherpad.</li>

                choosing the add-ons “puzzle piece” button to discover and
                install the add-ons that are most useful to you.

                   Firefox Sync is a built-in feature of Firefox that lets you
                   synchronize your desktop and mobile data. To use this
                   feature, you must first install  <a  href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/">Firefox for the desktop (version 4 or higher)</a>. Then go to Tools, Set Up Sync and   follow  the  prompts to create a Sync Account. Once you have an account   on your   desktop, go to Firefox on your mobile phone, tap on Browser Tools button. Scroll down the Preferences pane and tap Connect  under the Sync section. A one-time code will appear. Go back to your Sync account info, select “Add Device” and enter the code from your phone.

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Firefox on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.

                <dt>What are the trade-offs to using Firefox Sync in Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                   Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is still in its experimental phase. Those who use Firefox Sync and who have  large desktop profiles, may detect performance issues on their mobile.  We are working to resolve this in future releases.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the

                  require developers to make changes to their add-ons in order

                <dt>What browser engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 2.0.1,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.
                  
                <dt>What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox includes the new “<a  href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/jagermonkey/">JaegerMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The JaegerMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dt>How do I develop a Location-Aware website for Firefox?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox has implemented the first public draft of the
                  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/">Geolocation specification from the W3C</a>.

                <dt>Does Firefox on my mobile support HTML 5?</dt>
                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like
                  <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/geolocation/">Location-Aware browsing</a>,

                <dd>
                  There is currently no plugin support in Firefox for Android, and plugins are disabled in Firefox for Nokia N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin on Nokia N900 didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins in Firefox for Nokia N900 for experimentation and testing only.
