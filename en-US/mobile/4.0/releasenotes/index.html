 <ul>
Our Release Candidate is a very important step towards our final release. Since the previous (Beta 5) version, we improved performance even more, and we fixed numerous bugs and added some important features. Based on all the great user feedback we have received, we have continued to focus on making the browser faster, more stable, and more usable with this version:
<br>
<li>Add-ons<ul>
    <li>There are now over 150 <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/mobile/extensions/">add-ons</a> for Firefox for mobile, and counting. Dozens of add-ons are already compatible with our latest browser version. Thanks to our awesome community, the number of exciting compatible add-ons increase constantly. Check out the winners of our <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/mobile/2011/01/20/congrats-mobile-add-ons-cup-winners/">Mobile Add-on Cup</a> and many other amazing extensions for your mobile browser.
</ul></li>

<li>Performance and Memory Usage<ul>
    <li>We improved startup speed even more (compared to previous Beta versions). This was a top user request.</li>
    <li>Improved page load speed</li>
    <li>In Beta 5 we introduce the feature to move Firefox to the SD card along with all  its profile data (requires Android 2.2 or higher). This reduces memory usage on your mobile device to a minimum and leaves more space for other apps.</li>
    <li>Scrolling and page rendering are significantly faster and much smoother, showing far less checkerboarding. Smarter page rendering and page loading algorithms led to this very visible improvement.</li>
    <li>JavaScript is faster - our benchmarks show additional performance improvement compared to previous Beta releases.</li>
    <li>Reducing memory and optimizing CPU usage are ongoing themes. We have been working on improvements in this area to make the browser more responsive and stable. 
Overall responsiveness has improved. With this version, we have implemented additional optimizations that speed up the browser and make it much more responsive, especially when using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mobile/features/#sync">Firefox Sync</a>.
You will see continuous improvement in our future releases</li>
  </ul></li>

  <li>User Interface<ul>
  <li>Filling out forms is now easier than ever with our improved Form Assistant: tapping into form fields zooms you in swiftly and shows a list of suggested values to make navigation easy and to minimize typing. This is particularly useful when using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/mobile/features/#sync">Firefox Sync</a>, which helps synchronize form data like user names and passwords (and also bookmarks, browsing history) across your connected devices, so you never have to type a user / password or other form fill data twice. The new controls make it very easy to fill in forms in web pages.</li>
  <li>It is now easier to close the sidebars without accidentally reopening them.</li>
  <li>We now support copy and paste for all form fields on web pages.</li>
  <li>We fixed miscellaneous bugs, introduced usability improvements, and optimized the user experience with this release. Firefox 4 for mobile Release Candidate is also more stable than previous versions. See "Known Issues" below for details on fixed bugs</li>
  <li>Japanese is now included in the default set of languages for the Firefox user interface.</i>
  </ul></li>

  <li>For developers<ul>
      <li>NOW is the time to build new awesome add-on or to make all your mobile add-ons compatible with our Release Candidate. Our interfaces are all stable, we don't expect any changes for our final release that would impace add-ons. Go! Find all the tools and resources you need on our  <a=href"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/developers">Developer Hub</a>
</li>
    <li>Firefox 4 adds support for IPv6 on Android.
    <li>The "overflow: scroll" and "overflow: auto" CSS properties are now supported.
     <li>In Beta 4 we introduced <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">restartless  add-ons</a></li>
     <li>Also in Beta 4 we started providing support for <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/online_and_offline_events">HTML5  online/offline events</a></li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

          <p>As well as these features from the <a  href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/4.0b4/releasenotes//">previous  Firefox Betas:</a></p>

          <ul>

          Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same
          technology platform, there are differences that will require
          developers to make changes to their add-ons in order to become
          compatible with Firefox 4 for Android and Maemo.
New:  We now support <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions/Bootstrapped_extensions">restartless  add-ons</a>. Visit the <a

                Add-ons are small
                pieces of software that let you add or change the look or
                functionality of Firefox. Install add-ons directly to your
                Firefox by swiping to the left and tapping on the browser tools
                "gear" button on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, then
                choosing the add-ons “puzzle piece” button to discover and
                install the add-ons that are most useful to you.

                <dd>
                   Firefox Sync is a built-in feature of Firefox 4 that lets you
                   synchronize your desktop and mobile data. To use this
                   feature, you must first install  <a  href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/beta/">Firefox 4 for  the desktop</a>. Then go to Tools, Set Up Sync and follow the  prompts to create a Sync Account. Once you have an account on your  desktop, go to Firefox on your mobile phone, tap on Browser Tools  button. Scroll down the Preferences pane and tap Connect  under the Sync  section. A one-time code will appear. Go back to your Sync account  info, select “Add Device” and enter the code from your phone.

                <dt>Do I need to setup Firefox Sync to use Firefox 4 on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is
                  feature that you can choose to use or not. The Awesome Screen
                  will start to get to know you and take you to your favorite
                  parts of the Web with minimal typing, even without Firefox
                  Sync.

                <dt>What are the trade-offs to using Firefox Sync in Firefox 4 (RC)?</dt>
                <dd>
                Although we think Firefox Sync is highly useful, it is  still in its experimental phase. Those who use Firefox Sync and who have  large desktop profiles, may detect performance issues on their mobile.  We are working to resolve this in future releases.

                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your
                  location with a website, it can use that information to
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional,
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional –
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the

                  require developers to make changes to their add-ons in order

                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine.
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 4.0b8,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance,
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.
                  
                <dt>What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Firefox includes the new “<a  href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/category/jagermonkey/">JaegerMonkey</a>”
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology.
                  The JaegerMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it,
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                <dd>
                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML.
                  The HTML 5 specification is ongoing,
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like

                <dd>
                  There is no plugin support in Firefox 4 for Android, and plugins are disable in Firefox 4 for Nokia
                  N900. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the
                  performance of the plugin on Nokia N900 didn't meet our standards, and the
                  interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was
                  negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with
                  multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable
                  plugins in Firefox for Nokia N900 for experimentation and testing only.
