				<h4>Stay in Sync</h4>
				<p>Sync seamlessly connects your desktop and mobile Firefoxes, so you can access your browsing history, passwords, bookmarks and even open tabs no matter which device you use. Access years of desktop browsing the first day you fire up your mobile, and use saved passwords from your desktop to fill out forms on your phone.</p>
				<img src="/img/covehead/mobile/screen-sync-mobile.png" width="290" height="160" alt="" />
				<p>Now you can surf the Web on your desktop, get up in the middle of browsing and have your open tabs ready and waiting on your mobile, just as you left them. Your browsing will never be the same! <a href="/<?=$lang?>/mobile/sync/">Learn more.</a></p>
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Mobile Add-ons</h4>
				<p>Customize Firefox to fit exactly the way you browse with our growing catalog of <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/">mobile add-ons</a>. Discover and install them directly from your phone! Any developer can <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/mobile/developers/">build a mobile add-on for Firefox</a> or easily adapt an existing one to be optimized for mobile devices.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="column2">
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Awesome Screen: Type Less, Browse More</h4>
				<p>Typing isn’t always easy on mobile devices, which is why we made the Awesome Screen. It gets to know you as you browse, and offers a smart list of shortcuts to your favorite sites, bookmarked pages and tabs from your other computers. Just tap the Awesome Bar (Smart Location Bar) to get started.</p>
				<img src="/img/covehead/mobile/screen-awesomebar-mobile.png" width="290" height="160" alt="" />
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Search Engines</h4>
				<p>For maximum search power, multiple search engines appear when you start typing in the Awesome Bar. You can also tap on the magnifier next to the Awesome Bar to see a list of your search engine options, or customize this list to your liking through the Add-ons Manager.</p>

				<h4>Your Start Page</h4>
				<p>Firefox’s personalized start page gives you instant access to your desktop tabs, the tabs you had open the previous time you browsed on your phone and recommendations for useful add-ons.</p>
				<img src="/img/covehead/mobile/screen-start-mobile.png" width="290" height="160" alt="" />
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Dress Up Your Firefox</h4>
				<p>The mobile Firefox gives you access to <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/?source=moz.com_features">thousands of easy-to-install themes called Personas</a>, meaning you can change the look of your browser to practically anything with just a tap. Choose anything from simple designs to colorful patterns to content from partners like Harry Potter and Bob Marley.</p>

			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Full Screen View</h4>
				<p>There’s not a lot of room for extra stuff on your phone screen, so we’ve designed Firefox to stay out of the way of the content you’re looking at. Once you land on your destination the Awesome Bar and controls get stowed out of view, but they’re easy to find again: just swipe left and right to see your tabs and browser tools, or swipe up to start another search. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Zoom!</h4>
				<p>Reading tiny content on a small strain can strain even the best eyesight. To swiftly zoom in and out of any page, just pinch-to-zoom (Android) or double tap (Android/Maemo) any time you’d like to take a closer look.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="column2">
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Tabbed Browsing</h4>
				<p>Enjoy the convenience of tabs on your desktop? The mobile Firefox has tabs, too! Simply swipe to the right and you’ll see all your open tabs as thumbnails so you can easily see where you’d like to go next. Tap the plus button to open a new tab, and if you accidentally close one of your tabs you can tap the Undo button to bring it back. </p>

				<h4>One-Touch Bookmarking</h4>
				<p>Swipe to the left and bookmark a site you love with one touch. Then, you can tag and save it to make sure it always appears in your Awesome Screen for easy access.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="column2">
			<div class="feature">
				<h4>Location-Aware Browsing</h4>
				<p>Need directions, help finding a restaurant or other info relevant to your current location? Firefox saves you time and clicks by allowing sites to ask your phone were you are. It’s handy, but also optional – Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission. <a href="/<?=$lang?>/firefox/geolocation/">Learn more.</a></p>
