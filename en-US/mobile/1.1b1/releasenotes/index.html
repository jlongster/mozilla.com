            <h5>Important: for Ovi Store customers</h5>
            <p>
              If you installed Firefox 1.0 from the Ovi Store, you will not be able to
              upgrade to Firefox 1.1 Beta 1 (either from the N900 Application Manager or by
              downloading the software from Mozilla). We are working to solve this for future
              releases so that anyone can participate in our Beta programs. Don't worry,
              though, if you got Firefox 1.0 from either the Ovi store or directly from
              Mozilla, you <em>will</em> be updated to Firefox 1.1 (final) when it is released.

                <dd>
                  Firefox is in early development for the Android platform. 
                  We continue to investigate ways to bring the Firefox experience to users, 
                  regardless of their device or platform.

                <dd>
                  Fennec is the codename of Mozilla’s mobile project, however, 
                  the official product name is Firefox.  Same as the desktop.
                  Enjoy the same Firefox experience that you’ve come 
                  to know and trust on the desktop, now available for mobile.

                <dt>How will Firefox keep me safe while I browse on my mobile?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Mozilla’s open source process leverages the experience of 
                  thousands of security experts around the globe, 
                  and Firefox includes features like instant Web site ID 
                  that checks on suspicious sites to ensure they’re what 
                  they claim to be. Customizable security settings to 
                  manage passwords, cookies, loading images and installing 
                  add-ons give you complete control over your browsing experience.

                <dt>How do I use the Firefox user interface to browse the Web?</dt>
                <dd>
                  To save space on your phone’s display, Firefox browser controls are stowed away to the sides of the screen. Swipe right to access your tabs on the left side of the screen. Swipe left to view one-touch bookmarking, back and forward, and access your browser tools. To let you see more of the Web site, your browser controls and Awesome Bar get stowed away out of view. when you scroll down a Web page, but they instantly reappear if you pan to either side.
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I zoom in and out?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Double tap the screen with your finger to zoom in and out. On the Nokia N900, you can also now use the volume rocker on the top of the device to zoom in and out. Also, on the Nokia N900, Ctrl-up and Ctrl-down arrows will zoom in and out.

                <dt>How do I bookmark a Web page?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Go to the site you wish to bookmark. Touch the bookmark “star” button on the right side of your display.
                </dd>
                <dt>How do I open a new tab?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Touch the new tab "plus" button on the left side of your display screen to open a new tab. Tabs appear as thumbnails so you can easily see which page you’d like to select.
                </dd>
                <dt>What are Firefox Add-ons and how can I get them on my mobile device?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Add-ons let you customize your Firefox by adding features and customizations that help make your browser your own. Select the Tools “gear” button on the bottom right-hand side of your screen, then choose the add-ons “puzzle piece” button and search for and install the add-ons that are most useful to you directly from your phone.
                </dd>
                <dt>How can I share my Firefox bookmarks, history, tabs, and passwords between my desktop and my mobile?</dt>
                <dd>
                   The Weave Sync add-on brings your Firefox experience to your mobile phone. First, create a Weave Sync account on your desktop. Then go to Firefox on your mobile and search for and install the Weave Sync add-on. Enter your Weave Sync account info and select "sync" to share your Firefox bookmarks, history, passwords and open tabs between your desktop and your mobile.
                </dd>
                <dt>Do I need to get the Weave Sync add-on to use Firefox on my phone?</dt>
                <dd>
                  No. Although we think that syncing Firefox between your desktop and mobile with Weave Sync is highly useful, it is an optional service that you can choose to use or not. You will still be able to break in your Firefox mobile Web browser with the Awesome Bar, which remembers where you go and how often, getting to your favorite sites very quickly.
                </dd>
                <dt>What is Location-Aware Browsing? Is Firefox tracking where I am?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Location-Aware Browsing saves you time by allowing websites 
                  to ask you where you are. If you choose to share your 
                  location with a website, it can use that information to 
                  find nearby points of interest and return additional, 
                  useful data like maps of your area. It’s all optional – 
                  Firefox doesn’t share your location without your permission.

                <dd>
                  Although Firefox for the desktop and mobile are built on the same platform, 
                  there are small differences that will require developers to make changes to their add-ons.

                <dd>
                  The desktop and mobile versions of Firefox both use the Gecko rendering engine. 
                  The mobile version of Firefox uses Gecko version 1.9.2,
                  which is the best performing browser engine Mozilla has ever 
                  released and includes exciting features such as radically improved JavaScript performance, 
                  geolocation support, worker threads, and much more.What JavaScript engine does Firefox use?
                  Firefox includes the new “<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/tracemonkey-overview/">TraceMonkey</a>” 
                  JavaScript engine, an advanced JIT (“just in time”) compiler using tracing technology. 
                  The TraceMonkey engine makes Web applications faster by compiling code as you execute it, 
                  allowing many types of CPU-intensive applications to run at near-native speed.

                  HTML 5 is the next major revision of HTML. 
                  The HTML 5 specification is an ongoing work, 
                  but there are several HTML 5 and related features 
                  that will enable Web developers to create more innovative 
                  websites and applications. Firefox includes important features like

                <dt>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins?</dt>
                <dd>
                  Support for plugins in Firefox for Maemo has been disabled. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the performance of the plugin didn't meet our standards, and the interactivity and performance of the entire Web page was negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable plugins for experimentation and testing purposes only. We are working on ways for the user to have control of which sites to enable plugins for, as some sites, like YouTube, do work quite well. We plan to provide a browser add-on that will enable you to selectively enable plugins on certain sites, because some sites, like YouTube, work well.
