    <p>Dear <kbd>[enter mom/brother/colleague/dog walker/whoever here]</kbd>,</p>
    <p>It's time we had a little talk about how awesome Mozilla Firefox 4 is: It's pretty awesome. 
    I know you've been missing out, so I'm here to help.</p>
    
    <p>I've had it for a few weeks now and I can tell you that it makes my online experience better 
    every day. Not surprising since it's made to make the Web a better place.</p>
    
    <p>So here are some helpful tips to get Firefox 4 and see all the awesomeness for yourself:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Download this step-by-step guide to installing Firefox (I repeat: easy):<br/>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/webhero/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_MAC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1MB)">PDF Install guide for Mac</a><br/>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/webhero/Firefox4_Installation_Guide_PC.pdf" title="Download this PDF (1.5MB)">PDF Install guide for PC</a>
      </li>
      <li>Take the tour and see the best Firefox 4 has to offer: 
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central">http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/central</a>
      </li>
      <li>Or watch a video or two about the latest features:
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video">http://www.mozilla.com/<?= $lang ?>/firefox/video</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>OK, now you've got it. So you're not only getting the best the Web has to offer, you're also 
    helping make sure that it stays open, accessible, transparent, safe and — most of all — awesome. 
    Pretty cool, right? That's because Mozilla Firefox values principles over profit and answers to 
    no one but you.</p>
    
    <p>Oh, and if all that seems like too much, I'd be happy to come over and install it for you. 
    We could have a coffee, hang out and catch up. It just wouldn't be fair to keep Firefox 4 all 
    to myself.</p>
    
    <p>Yours in better browsing,</p>
