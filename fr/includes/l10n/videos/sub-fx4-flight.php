$sub[3]  = "This is being rendered in real-time in a web browser and is really a demonstration of what browsers will be able to do in the future and what Firefox 4 will be able to do when we release it.";

$sub[4]  = "The first thing you need to realize is that this is a mix of HTML5, WebGL-- it includes support for Audio, Canvas and uses a library called processing.js and remixes a whole bunch of content from the Web.";

$sub[5]  = "The titles that you are seeing here are just chunks of HTML. If you were able to mouse over them you would see that the cursor would change so you can highlight it, cut and paste it into other applications.";

$sub[6]  = "Later in this demo you're going to see us pull-in a whole bunch of content from the rest of the Web as well.";

$sub[7]  = "We pull images from flickR, we pull data in real-time from Twitter";

$sub[8]  = "Right around the 3 minute mark and the 5 minute mark you'll see an embedded HTML5 video, directly embedded in the middle of this scene. ";

$sub[10] = "So, the last thing you should know about this demo is that it was put together by about half-a-dozen people on the Web.";

$sub[11] = "They didn't really know each other, they met each other, they were able to put together this demo based on some basic knowledge of some basic off the shelf tools and put it together in a couple of weeks.";

$sub[12] = "They had never done 3D modeling before, they'd never done a bunch of web-programming before,";

$sub[13] = "but one of the things that this shows off is the ability to democratize tools";

$sub[14] = "and to make it available to a wider set of people that can then take these tools that are available on the Web and do interesting things, is part of what this demo is about.";
