<div data-start="0">Welcome to Sync in Firefox&nbsp;4 Beta</div>

<div data-start="3">With Sync, you have instant access to all of your important Firefox data, including your bookmarks, history, saved passwords and even open tabs wherever you use Firefox, including on all of your computers and a growing number of mobile phones.</div>

<div data-start="18">In a rush to leave but just found an interesting new website?  With Sync, you can pick up just where you left off at home, at work or on the go – Just like magic.</div>

<div data-start="28">To enable Sync, you’ll need to create an account. So let’s get started.</div>

<div data-start="32">When you download the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;4 Beta, you will be prompted to create a Firefox Sync account</div>

<div data-start="39">If you've been using Firefox Sync already, simply click “I’m already using Sync on another computer” and log in. You're all set.</div>

<div data-start="49">If this is your first time using Sync, click “I’ve never used Sync before”. Enter a username, password and email address.</div>

<div data-start="63">Now create a secret phrase. This 12 character or more phrase acts like the key to your safety deposit box where only you have access to it. Don’t lost it since it protects your data.</div>

<div data-start="76">Click "next" unless you want to host the data on your own server.</div>

<div data-start="80">Type the words as they appear.</div>

<div data-start="86">Then click “Finish”.  You now have a Firefox Sync account!</div>

<div data-start="91">Your Firefox data will start syncing in the background.</div>

<div data-start="96">When you set up Sync for the first time, this might take a few moments, but you can continue browsing the web.</div>

<div data-start="104">Once the initial sync is complete, the rotating icon in the lower right corner of your browser will change into the Sync icon.</div>

<div data-start="113">From here on out, Sync will keep updating your data periodically to ensure you stay in Sync.</div>

<div data-start="119">Don't forget to set up Sync on all of your computers;</div>
