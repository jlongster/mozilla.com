        <h3>More feedback needed!</h3>
        <p>
            Thanks to you, we've received over one million pieces of feedback on Firefox 4 Beta. But, even more always helps! Just click the feedback button in the top right of the browser to let us know what you do and don't like (and be sure to include the URL, too).

        <h4>How are your favorite sites performing?</h4>
        <p>
          Do they load quickly? Are you seeing any unusual lines or boxes? Can you fill out forms? Does Flash work? Can you watch videos? <a href="<?=$feedbackurl?>">Tell us about sites that have problems.</a>

        <h4>Can you play your favorite online game?</h4>
        <p>
          Help us make sure that sites that use Flash and other multimedia components run smoothly on Firefox 4. Is the experience faster? Or, did the game cause a crash? <a href="<?=$feedbackurl?>">Let us know what games do and don't work.</a>

        <h4>What add-ons have you tried?</h4>
        <p>
          Are your favorite add-ons compatible with Firefox 4 Beta? Which ones aren't working? Has the new Add-ons Manager helped you stay organized? (Note: to start using add-ons with Firefox 4 Beta look for 4.0.* under "Works with" in the Add-ons Manager.) <a href="<?=$feedbackurl?>">Tell us what you think.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Or if you want to help even more, install the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/15003">Add-ons Compatibility Reporter</a>. With this extension, if you notice that one of your add-ons doesn't seem to be working the same way it did in previous Firefox versions, just open the Add-ons Manager and click Compatibility next to that add-on to send a report to Mozilla.

        <h4>Have you set up a Sync account?</h4>
        <p>
          If you have a Sync account, how was the set-up process? Could you sync your data on your Android device with the Mobile Beta, or on your iPhone with Firefox Home? If you haven't set up a Sync account, could you find the Sync feature in your browser? <a href="<?=$feedbackurl?>">Give us feedback on Sync</a>.
