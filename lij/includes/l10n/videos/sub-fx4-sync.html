<div data-start="33.1">When you download the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;4 Beta, you'll be prompted to create a Firefox Sync account</div>

<div data-start="39">If you've been using Firefox Sync already, simply click “I’m already using Sync on another computer” and log in. You're all set.</div>

<div data-start="49">If this is your first time using Sync, click “I’ve never used Sync before”.</div>

<div data-start="54">Enter a username... password...  and email address.</div>

<div data-start="64">Now create a secret phrase.</div>

<div data-start="66">This 12 character or more phrase acts like the key to your safety deposit box where only you have access to it.</div>

<div data-start="72.8">Don’t lose it since it protects your data.</div>

<div data-start="75.5">Click "next" unless you want to host the data on your own server.</div>

<div data-start="80.2">Type the words as they appear.</div>

<div data-start="83" data-special="blank"></div>

<div data-start="86">Then click “Finish”.  You now have a Firefox Sync account!</div>

<div data-start="92">Your Firefox data will start syncing in the background.</div>

<div data-start="97">When you set up Sync for the first time, this might take a few moments, but you can continue browsing the web.</div>

<div data-start="104">Once the initial sync is complete, the rotating icon in the lower right corner of your browser will change into the Sync icon.</div>

<div data-start="113">From here on out, Sync will keep updating your data periodically to ensure you stay in Sync.</div>
