Nutch-Interface
---------------

This is a library that is designed to be checked out as an SVN External for your
project.  When checking out, use a specific revision instead of HEAD as there are no
trunk/tag versions.

This library provides a simple interface to a running instance of Nutch.  To use this 
library include the class and create an instance of it.  This should get you started:

try {

    $nutch = new mozNutch('http://nutch.server.com/');
    $results = $nutch->query('test', 10, 0);

    echo $nutch->transformXmlToHtml($results);

} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}

The class is well documented.  Please read it for additional details.  This library
requires php5 compiled with DOM support.
