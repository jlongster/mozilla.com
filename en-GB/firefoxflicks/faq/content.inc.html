<h2>Firefox Flicks FAQ</h2>

<dl class="faq">

<dt>What is Firefox Flicks?</dt>
<dd>Firefox Flicks is a contest that invites Firefox fans and filmmakers from all over the world to create short videos (or “flicks”) to help tell the Firefox story.</dd>

<dt>When will the contest open?</dt>
<dd>The Firefox Flicks contest site will open in February 2012. You’ll be able to upload your video and public voting will take place there later in the year. We'll be posting more information on this soon, so check back often.</dd>

<dt>Can I submit more than one flick?</dt>
<dd>You can submit as many as you like, but you have to submit a new entry each time.</dd>

<dt>Can a team develop the flick?</dt>
<dd>Of course! Teams can be up to 10 people. We will, however, be sending out a maximum of one Firefox prize pack per submission to be shared with the team. Also, please appoint a team leader. All communication will be with this person and only one prize will be awarded per entry.</dd>

<dt>Is the contest open to international entries?</dt>
<dd>Yes. This contest is open to anyone in world. We will, however, choose one winner for North America, one winner for Latin American, one winner for Asia, Australia & New Zealand and one winner for the European Union (or whichever of those is closest to where you’re from). Please see the <a href="#">contest rules</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>What are the judging criteria?</dt>
<dd>Videos will be judged on quality of shooting, editing and how closely they align with the <a href="<?=$link[0]?>">creative brief</a>.</p>

<p>Entires will be judged in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best :30 Spot</li>
<li>Best Animation</li>
<li>Best Use of New Technology (e.g. Popcorn.js, shot entirely with a mobile device, 3D)</li>
<li>Best Public Service Announcement</li>
</ul>

<p>A panel of judges will choose the grand prize winner from a selection of videos that have been voted on by the public.</dd>

<dt>Who are the judges?</dt>
<dd>We've put together a team of amazing international judges from the fields of advertising, filmmaking and beyond. Judges will be added to the panel over the next few months.</dd>

<dt>What can I win?</dt>
<dd>Simply by competing, your flick will be seen and voted on by millions of Firefox fans around the world, giving you exposure to a global audience. You'll also get your entry in front of international advertising executives and film luminaries while working on one of the world's biggest brands — a great piece to add to any portfolio.</p>

<p>But there's more! The grand prize winner in each region (North America, Latin America, EU and Asia, Australia & New Zealand) will receive their choice of either $5,000 in video equipment or a film school scholarship. The top two winners in each category get $1,000 in video equipment. Top category winners for each region and the grand prize winner will also get a trip to a Firefox Flicks event in 2012. Any video that makes it into the contest will get a Firefox prize pack. On top of all that, if you win, your flick could be used to share the amazing story of Firefox with the world.</dd>
