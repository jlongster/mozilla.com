This mn folder is for the Mongolian locale, please don't delete it.

We had Firefox in Mongolian up to Firefox 3.5 and used to have minimal support for this locale on the website.
Since we no longer support that locale neither for Firefox nor for Thunderbird and no longer have a localizer, we deleted the mn folder and remapped it to en-GB locale (remapping to en-US does not work because of htaccess rules preventing it).

We keep an mn/ folder to allow the remapping of older urls and prevent 404s for external links, specifically in-product links in older versions of Firefox.

This was done in bug 672473.
