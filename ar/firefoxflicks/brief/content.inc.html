<h2>الموجز الإبداعي</h2>

<h3>دعوة إلى العمل</h3>
<p>We need your help to tell the amazing story of Mozilla Firefox, our users and how one browser can build a brighter future for the Web.</p>

<h3>وصف المشروع</h3>
<p>Create a video ad or story (a “flick”) in one of <a href="#categories">four categories</a> that helps people better understand the issues facing them online and shows how Firefox helps them deal with these issues. In short, help us tell the story of Firefox — why we do what we do and how that helps users on the Web.</p>

<h3>ملخص المشروع</h3>
<p>Mozilla wants the world to know more about what makes Firefox different: that we’re a non-profit organization aimed at keeping the power of the Web in people’s hands. Our hope is that through high-quality videos, we can help mainstream Internet users know more about the issues that affect their online lives and, more importantly, how Firefox addresses these issues. Winning videos will be used in worldwide marketing campaigns and public service announcements.</p>

<h3>الهدف</h3>
<p>Help us educate consumers about one or all of the following online issues facing them today:</p>

<ul>
<li>الخصوصية: How are you being tracked online? How can you take control of it? Who owns your data and how do they use it?</li>
<li>الخيار: How easy is it for you to experience the Web using the tools that you like and that suit your needs? Can you make it personal?</li>
<li>قابلية العمل على أجهزة مختلفة: Can you use your favorite tools on all your devices, different computers or in different locations? Who decides when, where and how you use the Web and access your stuff?</li>
<li>Opportunity: What tools do users need to help them make the Web they want? How does Firefox help?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, drive awareness of our key brand attributes, specifically around the fact that Firefox is made by a non-profit organization that answers only to users, not shareholders. Have a look at our <a href="<?=$link[0]?>">Brand Platform</a> for more details and check out the video below.</p>

<h3>نحن نخاطب من؟</h3>
<p>Your flick should target mainstream Internet users between the ages of 25 and 54 — people who use the Web to read the news, write e-mails, bank online and connect on social networks. Help explain the challenges facing the Web in terms that these average everyday users will understand. As an extreme example, how would you explain the importance of having control over your own online experience to someone who only understands the Firefox logo as the "Internet" button? We need you to communicate to this audience that Firefox is a non-profit doing good for the benefit of people everywhere.</p>

<h3>الرسالة الأساسية الأولية</h3>
<p>Firefox prioritizes principles over profit to put you in control of your online experience and shape the future of the Web for the public good. Firefox answers to no one but you.</p>

<h3>نقاط ثانوية للرسالة الأساسية:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are important online issues like privacy, choice, flexibility and opportunity facing you every day.</li>
<li>Mozilla addresses these issues and works to ensure that the Web remains open and accessible to all.</li>
<li>Mozilla is proudly non-profit.</li>
</ul>
