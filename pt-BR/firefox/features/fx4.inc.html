                    <p>Firefox provides uninterrupted browsing when there is a crash in the Adobe Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight plugins. If one of these commonly-used plugins crashes or freezes, it won't affect the rest of Firefox. Instead, you can simply reload the page to restart the plugin and try again. <a href="<?=$link[4];?>">Learn more about plugins.</a></p>

                <p>Having a super fast JavaScript engine is definitely important, but since those changes are often measured in milliseconds sometimes what matters even more is the way the browser feels when you’re actually using it. That’s why we’re constantly optimizing Firefox to be great for the way you use the web – things like making new tabs open up more quickly, or having the Awesome Bar provide results even faster. In the end, it’s about getting you where you need to go as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
