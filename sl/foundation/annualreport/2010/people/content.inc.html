        <p>In the Mozilla world, people are everything. Building freedom into the Internet means ensuring that communities of people are free to build the Internet they want.</p>
        <p>New Mozilla communities have sprung up in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, further expanding the reach and diversity of Mozilla.</p>

        <p>Communities and locales in the Arabic-speaking world experienced inspiring growth this year and came together to form a collective community called <a href="<?=$link[1]?>">ArabicMozilla</a>. Participating countries include Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Morocco and Sudan. In July, Mozilla Jordan hosted the region’s <a href="<?=$link[2]?>">inaugural inter-community meetup</a> in Amman.</p>

        <p>Representatives from <a href="<?=$link[3]?>">Mozilla Ghana</a> have begun participating in technical events and <a href="<?=$link[4]?>">Mozilla Kenya’s</a> community coordinator Alex Wafula has started an <a href="<?=$link[5]?>">outreach project</a> with universities across the country.</p>
        <p>Mozilla Cuba and Mozilla Nicaragua were organized and launched by local volunteers. At the same time, our <a href="<?=$link[6]?>">Mozilla Hispano</a> community has continued to thrive, expanding its ranks to 11 Spanish-speaking countries (find <a href="<?=$link[7]?>">full list of local communities here</a>).</p>

        <p>The <a href="<?=$link[8]?>">Mozilla community in Indonesia</a> has developed an Indonesian mascot character, "Kumi," which  has been  celebrated and distributed as a paper toy at many of this  year’s  events. The community now has regional leaders in the five largest cities in Indonesia, which have been actively promoting Mozilla and Firefox. Thanks to the enthusiasm and passion of this community, Firefox enjoys the largest market share in the world in Indonesia.</p>

        <p>The Mozilla communities in Europe are among our oldest and strongest. They remain fundamental to the health of the Mozilla project and led important discussions around how the Mozilla community can scale, while preserving local ownership and decision-making.</p>
        <p>We're growing Mozilla communities not directly related to building and evangelizing consumer products like Firefox in particular among educators, <a href="<?=$link[9]?>">journalists</a> and filmmakers.</p>
