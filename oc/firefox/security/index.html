        <h3>So How Do We Do It?</h3>
        <p>What makes Firefox different? Most importantly, we’re open. That means anyone around the world (and we have thousands of experts watching our back) is able to look into our code and find any potential weak spots in our armor.</p>
        <p>And when we hear about a problem, we roll up our sleeves and get to work fixing it right away. It’s in your best interest (and ours) to take care of the issue, even if it means admitting we’re a little less than perfect.</p>
        <p>Simply put, <strong>your security is our top priority.</strong></p>

        <h3>There’s a Method to Our Madness.</h3>
        <p>Nobody loves the Internet more than we do. But, scammers, spammers and trigger-happy viruses are true threats, so you need to protect yourself while using the Web.</p>

        <h3>That’s Where Firefox Comes In.</h3>
        <p>Using it is the safest way to surf the web because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We don’t try to tackle the problem alone.</strong> An international community of security experts is working around the clock to make your web browsing safer (thanks to our open source way of doing things). It’s like having your neighborhood watch led by a group of highly trained ninjas.</li>
            <li><strong>We consider your security every step of the way.</strong> Security experts work right from the start to identify and address potential problems before a single line of code is written.</li>
            <li><strong>We stay on top of the issue.</strong> We’re constantly monitoring threats and releasing new Firefox updates to stay one step ahead. Operating in an open source world means anyone can help us find and fix our weak spots.</li>
