    <div class="intro">
        <p><strong>We're a global community</strong>
            of <a href="../community">people working together</a> since 1998 to build a better Internet.</p>
      
        <p><strong>We're a non-profit organization</strong>
            dedicated to promoting <a href="mission.html">openness, innovation and opportunity</a> online.</p>
      
        <p><strong>And we're an open source project</strong>
            whose <a href="../projects">software</a> has been used to build some of the Internet's best applications.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We believe that, as the most significant social and technological development of our time, the Internet is a public resource that must be improved and 
    protected.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/foundation">Mozilla Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization dedicated to these goals, but the real force behind Mozilla is people 
    around the world taking action to build the web they want. <a href="/contribute">And you can help</a>!</p>
