Mozilla.com
===========

This is the codebase for mozilla.com, a site which Mozilla uses as a
central spot for promoting and providing free software, particularly
the Firefox web browser.

More information can be found on the wiki page:

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozilla.com

Downloading
-----------

Get the code from:

    * git: https://github.com/jlongster/mozilla.com
    * svn: https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk

Git support is still experimental; it is recommend for you to clone
the SVN repo directly if you intend to contribute. For reference, this
git repo was created using:

    git svn clone -r80321 https://svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk

Installing
----------

Make sure name-based virtual hosting is enabled.  In apache, check for
this line in httpd.conf:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

Copy /includes/config.inc.php-dist to /includes/config.inc.php and
fill out the variables (server_name and file_root are required).

Install the Virtual Host in apache. Example config:

    <Directory /path/to/mozilla.com>
            Options Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Indexes
            AllowOverride All
            Order Deny,Allow
            Allow from all
    </Directory>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName mozilla.local
        VirtualDocumentRoot "/path/to/mozilla.com"
    </VirtualHost>

The should be it. mozilla.com doesn't use any complicated frameworks,
so as long as you get PHP running it should work.

Depending on your Apache installation you might need the following
line within the VirtualHost block to allow PHP inside of html files:

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html

Git or SVN?
-----------

The site is primarily worked on through SVN, and git is only supported
as far as `git-svn`. Right now, this means you can use git all you
want in your development environment, but you can't map your git
branches to SVN or anything like that. When it comes time to commit,
use `git-svn` and always only commit one branch to SVN.

Contributing
------------

Please contact us (jlong@mozilla.com) if you are interesting in
contributing to this project. Localizing requires a lot of work, and
we couldn't support this many locales without the generous help of our
current localizers. Thanks!
