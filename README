Testing/Reviewing
-----------------
This is a special section that will be removed once the code is released. 
Also, the scope of this project is limited to just "in-project pages"
as defined on http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/In-Product_Web_Pages .


Description
-----------

This is the main mozilla.com site, now supporting many languages.  In it's first revision, it will only
support "in-product pages" in multiple languages ( defined here: http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox2/In-Product_Web_Pages ).


Requirements
------------
- Make sure name-based virtual hosting is enabled.  In apache, check for this line in httpd.conf:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

- DNS entries for any languages you will be supporting.  (For testing, pointing *.name.com -> name.com will work well).

- There is an .htaccess that must run on page requests

    AllowOverride All

- You must enable the following Apache Modules

    a2enmod expires 
    a2enmod actions
    a2enmod headers

How To Install
--------------


1) (Assuming apache) create a virutal host for your site that supports all DNS
entries you made.  Also be sure to add the Rewrite rules below.
Example:

        <VirtualHost *:80>
            ServerName www.mozilla.com
            ServerAlias *.www.mozilla.com
            DocumentRoot /data/www.mozilla.com
            AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html
            DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
            Options -Indexes

            RewriteEngine On
            RewriteMap toupper int:toupper
        </VirtualHost>

Notice that we're parsing html as php - this is for backwards compatibility with the stuff we migrated from mozilla-europe.


2) Check out the code from svn.mozilla.org/projects/mozilla.com/trunk/ to your webroot

3) Copy /includes/config.inc.php-dist to /includes/config.inc.php, and fill out all variables.
